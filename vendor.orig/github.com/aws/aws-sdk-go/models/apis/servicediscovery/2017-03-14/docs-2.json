If the endpoint that is specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA records to be unhealthy. </p> <p> <b>CNAME records</b> </p> <p>You can't specify settings for <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> when the <code>DNSConfig</code> includes <code>CNAME</code> for the value of <code>Type</code>. If you do, the <code>CreateService</code> request will fail with an <code>InvalidInput</code> error.</p> <p> <b>Request interval</b> </p> <p>The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is the number of seconds between the time that each Route 53 health checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.</p> <p> <b>Health checking regions</b> </p> <p>Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking regions. For a list of the current regions, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions\">Regions</a>.</p> <p> <b>Alias records</b> </p> <p>When you register an instance, if you include the <code>AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME</code> attribute, Route 53 creates an alias record. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Route 53 automatically sets <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for alias records. When <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> is true, the alias record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer.

Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see <a>RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must specify <code>WEIGHTED</code> for the value of <code>RoutingPolicy</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can't specify both <code>CNAME</code> for <code>Type</code> and settings for <code>HealthCheckConfig</code>.
