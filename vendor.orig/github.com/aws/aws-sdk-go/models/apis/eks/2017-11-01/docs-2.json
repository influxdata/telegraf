  "service": "<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. </p> <p>Amazon EKS runs three Kubernetes control plane instances across three Availability Zones to ensure high availability. Amazon EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version upgrades and patching for them.</p> <p>Amazon EKS is also integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications, including the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution</p> </li> <li> <p>IAM for authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon VPC for isolation</p> </li> </ul> <p>Amazon EKS runs up to date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.</p>",

The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint.</p> <p>Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.</p> <p>The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data flows).</p> <p>After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch worker nodes into your cluster.
