## Comments

### Driver aliases
Some database drivers are supported though another driver (e.g. CockroachDB). For other databases we provide a more
obvious name (e.g. postgres) compared to the driver name. For all of those drivers you might use an _alias_ name
during configuration.

### Example data-source-name DSN
The given examples are just that, so please check the driver documentation for the exact format
and available options and parameters. Please note that the format of a DSN might also change
between driver version.

### Type conversions
Telegraf relies on type conversion of the database driver and/or the golang sql framework. In case you find
any problem, please open an issue!

## Help
If nothing seems to work, you might find help in the telegraf forum or in the chat.

### The documentation is wrong
Please open an issue or even better send a pull-request!

### I found a bug
Please open an issue or even better send a pull-request!

### My database is not supported
We currently cannot support CGO drivers in telegraf! Please check if a **pure Go** driver for the [golang sql framework](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/) exists.
If you found such a driver, please let us know by opening an issue or even better by sending a pull-request!
