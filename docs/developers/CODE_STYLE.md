# Code Style

Code is required to be formatted using `gofmt`, this covers most code style
requirements.  It is also highly recommended to use `goimports` to
automatically order imports.

Please try to keep lines length under 80 characters, the exact number of
characters is not strict but it generally helps with readability.
