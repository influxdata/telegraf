# Telegraf Input Data Formats

Telegraf is able to parse the following input data formats into metrics:

1. [InfluxDB Line Protocol](#influx)
1. [JSON](#json)
1. [Graphite](#graphite)
1. [Value](#value), ie: 45 or "booyah"
1. [Nagios](#nagios) (exec input only)
1. [Collectd](#collectd)
1. [Dropwizard](#dropwizard)
1. [Grok](#grok)
1. [Logfmt](#logfmt)
1. [Wavefront](#wavefront)
1. [CSV](#csv)

Telegraf metrics, like InfluxDB
[points](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.10/write_protocols/line/),
are a combination of four basic parts:

1. Measurement Name
1. Tags
1. Fields
1. Timestamp

These four parts are easily defined when using InfluxDB line-protocol as a
data format. But there are other data formats that users may want to use which
require more advanced configuration to create usable Telegraf metrics.

Plugins such as `exec` and `kafka_consumer` parse textual data. Up until now,
these plugins were statically configured to parse just a single
data format. `exec` mostly only supported parsing JSON, and `kafka_consumer` only
supported data in InfluxDB line-protocol.

But now we are normalizing the parsing of various data formats across all
plugins that can support it. You will be able to identify a plugin that supports
different data formats by the presence of a `data_format` config option, for
example, in the exec plugin:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/tmp/test.sh", "/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "json"

  ## Additional configuration options go here
```

Each data_format has an additional set of configuration options available, which
I'll go over below.

# Influx:

There are no additional configuration options for InfluxDB line-protocol. The
metrics are parsed directly into Telegraf metrics.

#### Influx Configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/tmp/test.sh", "/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"
```

# JSON:

The JSON data format flattens JSON into metric _fields_.
NOTE: Only numerical values are converted to fields, and they are converted
into a float. strings are ignored unless specified as a tag_key (see below).

So for example, this JSON:

```json
{
    "a": 5,
    "b": {
        "c": 6
    },
    "ignored": "I'm a string"
}
```

Would get translated into _fields_ of a measurement:

```
myjsonmetric a=5,b_c=6
```

The _measurement_ _name_ is usually the name of the plugin,
but can be overridden using the `name_override` config option.

#### JSON Configuration:

The JSON data format supports specifying "tag_keys", "string_keys", and "json_query".
If specified, keys in "tag_keys" and "string_keys" will be searched for in the root-level
and any nested lists of the JSON blob. All int and float values are added to fields by default.
If the key(s) exist, they will be applied as tags or fields to the Telegraf metrics.
If "string_keys" is specified, the string will be added as a field.

The "json_query" configuration is a gjson path to an JSON object or
list of JSON objects. If this path leads to an array of values or
single data point an error will be thrown.  If this configuration
is specified, only the result of the query will be parsed and returned as metrics.

The "json_name_key" configuration specifies the key of the field whos value will be
added as the metric name.

Object paths are specified using gjson path format, which is denoted by object keys
concatenated with "." to go deeper in nested JSON objects.
Additional information on gjson paths can be found here: https://github.com/tidwall/gjson#path-syntax

The JSON data format also supports extracting time values through the
config "json_time_key" and "json_time_format". If "json_time_key" is set,
"json_time_format" must be specified.  The "json_time_key" describes the
name of the field containing time information.  The "json_time_format"
must be a recognized Go time format.
If parsing a Unix epoch timestamp in seconds, e.g. 1536092344.1, this config must be set to "unix" (case insensitive);
corresponding JSON value can have a decimal part and can be a string or a number JSON representation.
If value is in number representation, it'll be treated as a double precision float, and could have some precision loss.
If value is in string representation, there'll be no precision loss up to nanosecond precision. Decimal positions beyond that will be dropped.
If parsing a Unix epoch timestamp in milliseconds, e.g. 1536092344100, this config must be set to "unix_ms" (case insensitive);
corresponding JSON value must be a (long) integer and be in number JSON representation.
If there is no year provided, the metrics will have the current year.
More info on time formats can be found here: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse

For example, if you had this configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/tmp/test.sh", "/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "json"

  ## List of tag names to extract from JSON server response
  tag_keys = [
    "my_tag_1",
    "my_tag_2"
  ]

  ## The json path specifying where to extract the metric name from
  # json_name_key = ""

  ## List of field names to extract from JSON and add as string fields
  # json_string_fields = []

  ## gjson query path to specify a specific chunk of JSON to be parsed with
  ## the above configuration. If not specified, the whole file will be parsed.
  ## gjson query paths are described here: https://github.com/tidwall/gjson#path-syntax
  # json_query = ""

  ## holds the name of the tag of timestamp
  # json_time_key = ""

  ## holds the format of timestamp to be parsed
  # json_time_format = ""
```

with this JSON output from a command:

```json
{
    "a": 5,
    "b": {
        "c": 6
    },
    "my_tag_1": "foo"
}
```

Your Telegraf metrics would get tagged with "my_tag_1"

```
exec_mycollector,my_tag_1=foo a=5,b_c=6
```

If the JSON data is an array, then each element of the array is
parsed with the configured settings.  Each resulting metric will
be output with the same timestamp.

For example, if the following configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "json"

  ## List of tag names to extract from top-level of JSON server response
  tag_keys = [
    "my_tag_1",
    "my_tag_2"
  ]

  ## List of field names to extract from JSON and add as string fields
  # string_fields = []

  ## gjson query path to specify a specific chunk of JSON to be parsed with
  ## the above configuration. If not specified, the whole file will be parsed
  # json_query = ""

  ## holds the name of the tag of timestamp
  json_time_key = "b_time"

  ## holds the format of timestamp to be parsed
  json_time_format = "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST"
```

with this JSON output from a command:

```json
[
    {
        "a": 5,
        "b": {
            "c": 6,
            "time":"04 Jan 06 15:04 MST"
        },
        "my_tag_1": "foo",
        "my_tag_2": "baz"
    },
    {
        "a": 7,
        "b": {
            "c": 8,
            "time":"11 Jan 07 15:04 MST"
        },
        "my_tag_1": "bar",
        "my_tag_2": "baz"
    }
]
```

Your Telegraf metrics would get tagged with "my_tag_1" and "my_tag_2" and fielded with "b_c"
The metric's time will be a time.Time object, as specified by "b_time"

```
exec_mycollector,my_tag_1=foo,my_tag_2=baz b_c=6 1136387040000000000
exec_mycollector,my_tag_1=bar,my_tag_2=baz b_c=8 1168527840000000000
```

If you want to only use a specific portion of your JSON, use the "json_query"
configuration to specify a path to a JSON object.

For example, with the following config:
```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "json"

  ## List of tag names to extract from top-level of JSON server response
  tag_keys = ["first"]

  ## List of field names to extract from JSON and add as string fields
  string_fields = ["last"]

  ## gjson query path to specify a specific chunk of JSON to be parsed with
  ## the above configuration. If not specified, the whole file will be parsed
  json_query = "obj.friends"

  ## holds the name of the tag of timestamp
  # json_time_key = ""

  ## holds the format of timestamp to be parsed
  # json_time_format = ""
```

with this JSON as input:
```json
{
    "obj": {
        "name": {"first": "Tom", "last": "Anderson"},
        "age":37,
        "children": ["Sara","Alex","Jack"],
        "fav.movie": "Deer Hunter",
        "friends": [
            {"first": "Dale", "last": "Murphy", "age": 44},
            {"first": "Roger", "last": "Craig", "age": 68},
            {"first": "Jane", "last": "Murphy", "age": 47}
        ]
    }
}
```
You would recieve 3 metrics tagged with "first", and fielded with "last" and "age"

```
exec_mycollector, "first":"Dale" "last":"Murphy","age":44
exec_mycollector, "first":"Roger" "last":"Craig","age":68
exec_mycollector, "first":"Jane" "last":"Murphy","age":47
```

# Value:

The "value" data format translates single values into Telegraf metrics. This
is done by assigning a measurement name and setting a single field ("value")
as the parsed metric.

#### Value Configuration:

You **must** tell Telegraf what type of metric to collect by using the
`data_type` configuration option. Available options are:

1. integer
2. float or long
3. string
4. boolean

**Note:** It is also recommended that you set `name_override` to a measurement
name that makes sense for your metric, otherwise it will just be set to the
name of the plugin.

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail"]

  ## override the default metric name of "exec"
  name_override = "entropy_available"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "value"
  data_type = "integer" # required
```

# Graphite:

The Graphite data format translates graphite _dot_ buckets directly into
telegraf measurement names, with a single value field, and without any tags.
By default, the separator is left as ".", but this can be changed using the
"separator" argument. For more advanced options,
Telegraf supports specifying "templates" to translate
graphite buckets into Telegraf metrics.

Templates are of the form:

```
"host.mytag.mytag.measurement.measurement.field*"
```

Where the following keywords exist:

1. `measurement`: specifies that this section of the graphite bucket corresponds
to the measurement name. This can be specified multiple times.
2. `field`: specifies that this section of the graphite bucket corresponds
to the field name. This can be specified multiple times.
3. `measurement*`: specifies that all remaining elements of the graphite bucket
correspond to the measurement name.
4. `field*`: specifies that all remaining elements of the graphite bucket
correspond to the field name.

Any part of the template that is not a keyword is treated as a tag key. This
can also be specified multiple times.

NOTE: `field*` cannot be used in conjunction with `measurement*`!

#### Measurement & Tag Templates:

The most basic template is to specify a single transformation to apply to all
incoming metrics. So the following template:

```toml
templates = [
    "region.region.measurement*"
]
```

would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
us.west.cpu.load 100
=> cpu.load,region=us.west value=100
```

Multiple templates can also be specified, but these should be differentiated
using _filters_ (see below for more details)

```toml
templates = [
    "*.*.* region.region.measurement", # <- all 3-part measurements will match this one.
    "*.*.*.* region.region.host.measurement", # <- all 4-part measurements will match this one.
]
```

#### Field Templates:

The field keyword tells Telegraf to give the metric that field name.
So the following template:

```toml
separator = "_"
templates = [
    "measurement.measurement.field.field.region"
]
```

would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
cpu.usage.idle.percent.eu-east 100
=> cpu_usage,region=eu-east idle_percent=100
```

The field key can also be derived from all remaining elements of the graphite
bucket by specifying `field*`:

```toml
separator = "_"
templates = [
    "measurement.measurement.region.field*"
]
```

which would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
cpu.usage.eu-east.idle.percentage 100
=> cpu_usage,region=eu-east idle_percentage=100
```

#### Filter Templates:

Users can also filter the template(s) to use based on the name of the bucket,
using glob matching, like so:

```toml
templates = [
    "cpu.* measurement.measurement.region",
    "mem.* measurement.measurement.host"
]
```

which would result in the following transformation:

```
cpu.load.eu-east 100
=> cpu_load,region=eu-east value=100

mem.cached.localhost 256
=> mem_cached,host=localhost value=256
```

#### Adding Tags:

Additional tags can be added to a metric that don't exist on the received metric.
You can add additional tags by specifying them after the pattern.
Tags have the same format as the line protocol.
Multiple tags are separated by commas.

```toml
templates = [
    "measurement.measurement.field.region datacenter=1a"
]
```

would result in the following Graphite -> Telegraf transformation.

```
cpu.usage.idle.eu-east 100
=> cpu_usage,region=eu-east,datacenter=1a idle=100
```

There are many more options available,
[More details can be found here](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master/services/graphite#templates)

#### Graphite Configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/tmp/test.sh", "/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "graphite"

  ## This string will be used to join the matched values.
  separator = "_"

  ## Each template line requires a template pattern. It can have an optional
  ## filter before the template and separated by spaces. It can also have optional extra
  ## tags following the template. Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ## similar to the line protocol format. There can be only one default template.
  ## Templates support below format:
  ## 1. filter + template
  ## 2. filter + template + extra tag(s)
  ## 3. filter + template with field key
  ## 4. default template
  templates = [
    "*.app env.service.resource.measurement",
    "stats.* .host.measurement* region=eu-east,agent=sensu",
    "stats2.* .host.measurement.field",
    "measurement*"
  ]
```

# Nagios:

There are no additional configuration options for Nagios line-protocol. The
metrics are parsed directly into Telegraf metrics.

Note: Nagios Input Data Formats is only supported in `exec` input plugin.

#### Nagios Configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_load -w 5,6,7 -c 7,8,9"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "nagios"
```

# Collectd:

The collectd format parses the collectd binary network protocol.  Tags are
created for host, instance, type, and type instance.  All collectd values are
added as float64 fields.

For more information about the binary network protocol see
[here](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Binary_protocol).

You can control the cryptographic settings with parser options.  Create an
authentication file and set `collectd_auth_file` to the path of the file, then
set the desired security level in `collectd_security_level`.

Additional information including client setup can be found
[here](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Networking_introduction#Cryptographic_setup).

You can also change the path to the typesdb or add additional typesdb using
`collectd_typesdb`.

#### Collectd Configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.socket_listener]]
  service_address = "udp://127.0.0.1:25826"
  name_prefix = "collectd_"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "collectd"

  ## Authentication file for cryptographic security levels
  collectd_auth_file = "/etc/collectd/auth_file"
  ## One of none (default), sign, or encrypt
  collectd_security_level = "encrypt"
  ## Path of to TypesDB specifications
  collectd_typesdb = ["/usr/share/collectd/types.db"]

  # Multi-value plugins can be handled two ways.
  # "split" will parse and store the multi-value plugin data into separate measurements
  # "join" will parse and store the multi-value plugin as a single multi-value measurement.
  # "split" is the default behavior for backward compatability with previous versions of influxdb.
  collectd_parse_multivalue = "split"
```

# Dropwizard:

The dropwizard format can parse the JSON representation of a single dropwizard metric registry. By default, tags are parsed from metric names as if they were actual influxdb line protocol keys (`measurement<,tag_set>`) which can be overriden by defining custom [measurement & tag templates](./DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md#measurement--tag-templates). All field value types are supported, `string`, `number` and `boolean`.

A typical JSON of a dropwizard metric registry:

```json
{
	"version": "3.0.0",
	"counters" : {
		"measurement,tag1=green" : {
			"count" : 1
		}
	},
	"meters" : {
		"measurement" : {
			"count" : 1,
			"m15_rate" : 1.0,
			"m1_rate" : 1.0,
			"m5_rate" : 1.0,
			"mean_rate" : 1.0,
			"units" : "events/second"
		}
	},
	"gauges" : {
		"measurement" : {
			"value" : 1
		}
	},
	"histograms" : {
		"measurement" : {
			"count" : 1,
			"max" : 1.0,
			"mean" : 1.0,
			"min" : 1.0,
			"p50" : 1.0,
			"p75" : 1.0,
			"p95" : 1.0,
			"p98" : 1.0,
			"p99" : 1.0,
			"p999" : 1.0,
			"stddev" : 1.0
		}
	},
	"timers" : {
		"measurement" : {
			"count" : 1,
			"max" : 1.0,
			"mean" : 1.0,
			"min" : 1.0,
			"p50" : 1.0,
			"p75" : 1.0,
			"p95" : 1.0,
			"p98" : 1.0,
			"p99" : 1.0,
			"p999" : 1.0,
			"stddev" : 1.0,
			"m15_rate" : 1.0,
			"m1_rate" : 1.0,
			"m5_rate" : 1.0,
			"mean_rate" : 1.0,
			"duration_units" : "seconds",
			"rate_units" : "calls/second"
		}
	}
}
```

Would get translated into 4 different measurements:

```
measurement,metric_type=counter,tag1=green count=1
measurement,metric_type=meter count=1,m15_rate=1.0,m1_rate=1.0,m5_rate=1.0,mean_rate=1.0
measurement,metric_type=gauge value=1
measurement,metric_type=histogram count=1,max=1.0,mean=1.0,min=1.0,p50=1.0,p75=1.0,p95=1.0,p98=1.0,p99=1.0,p999=1.0
measurement,metric_type=timer count=1,max=1.0,mean=1.0,min=1.0,p50=1.0,p75=1.0,p95=1.0,p98=1.0,p99=1.0,p999=1.0,stddev=1.0,m15_rate=1.0,m1_rate=1.0,m5_rate=1.0,mean_rate=1.0
```

You may also parse a dropwizard registry from any JSON document which contains a dropwizard registry in some inner field.
Eg. to parse the following JSON document:

```json
{
	"time" : "2017-02-22T14:33:03.662+02:00",
	"tags" : {
		"tag1" : "green",
		"tag2" : "yellow"
	},
	"metrics" : {
		"counters" : 	{
			"measurement" : {
				"count" : 1
			}
		},
		"meters" : {},
		"gauges" : {},
		"histograms" : {},
		"timers" : {}
	}
}
```
and translate it into:

```
measurement,metric_type=counter,tag1=green,tag2=yellow count=1 1487766783662000000
```

you simply need to use the following additional configuration properties:

```toml
dropwizard_metric_registry_path = "metrics"
dropwizard_time_path = "time"
dropwizard_time_format = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
dropwizard_tags_path = "tags"
## tag paths per tag are supported too, eg.
#[inputs.yourinput.dropwizard_tag_paths]
#  tag1 = "tags.tag1"
#  tag2 = "tags.tag2"
```


For more information about the dropwizard json format see
[here](http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/manual/json/).

#### Dropwizard Configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["curl http://localhost:8080/sys/metrics"]
  timeout = "5s"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "dropwizard"

  ## Used by the templating engine to join matched values when cardinality is > 1
  separator = "_"

  ## Each template line requires a template pattern. It can have an optional
  ## filter before the template and separated by spaces. It can also have optional extra
  ## tags following the template. Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ## similar to the line protocol format. There can be only one default template.
  ## Templates support below format:
  ## 1. filter + template
  ## 2. filter + template + extra tag(s)
  ## 3. filter + template with field key
  ## 4. default template
  ## By providing an empty template array, templating is disabled and measurements are parsed as influxdb line protocol keys (measurement<,tag_set>)
  templates = []

  ## You may use an appropriate [gjson path](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson#path-syntax)
  ## to locate the metric registry within the JSON document
  # dropwizard_metric_registry_path = "metrics"

  ## You may use an appropriate [gjson path](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson#path-syntax)
  ## to locate the default time of the measurements within the JSON document
  # dropwizard_time_path = "time"
  # dropwizard_time_format = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"

  ## You may use an appropriate [gjson path](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson#path-syntax)
  ## to locate the tags map within the JSON document
  # dropwizard_tags_path = "tags"

  ## You may even use tag paths per tag
  # [inputs.exec.dropwizard_tag_paths]
  #   tag1 = "tags.tag1"
  #   tag2 = "tags.tag2"

The grok data format parses line delimited data using a regular expression like
language.

The best way to get acquainted with grok patterns is to read the logstash docs,
which are available here:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html

The grok parser uses a slightly modified version of logstash "grok"
patterns, with the format:

```
%{<capture_syntax>[:<semantic_name>][:<modifier>]}
```

The `capture_syntax` defines the grok pattern that's used to parse the input
line and the `semantic_name` is used to name the field or tag.  The extension
`modifier` controls the data type that the parsed item is converted to or
other special handling.

By default all named captures are converted into string fields.
Timestamp modifiers can be used to convert captures to the timestamp of the
parsed metric.  If no timestamp is parsed the metric will be created using the
current time.

You must capture at least one field per line.

- Available modifiers:
  - string   (default if nothing is specified)
  - int
  - float
  - duration (ie, 5.23ms gets converted to int nanoseconds)
  - tag      (converts the field into a tag)
  - drop     (drops the field completely)
  - measurement (use the matched text as the measurement name)
- Timestamp modifiers:
  - ts               (This will auto-learn the timestamp format)
  - ts-ansic         ("Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006")
  - ts-unix          ("Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 MST 2006")
  - ts-ruby          ("Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 -0700 2006")
  - ts-rfc822        ("02 Jan 06 15:04 MST")
  - ts-rfc822z       ("02 Jan 06 15:04 -0700")
  - ts-rfc850        ("Monday, 02-Jan-06 15:04:05 MST")
  - ts-rfc1123       ("Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST")
  - ts-rfc1123z      ("Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700")
  - ts-rfc3339       ("2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00")
  - ts-rfc3339nano   ("2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00")
  - ts-httpd         ("02/Jan/2006:15:04:05 -0700")
  - ts-epoch         (seconds since unix epoch, may contain decimal)
  - ts-epochnano     (nanoseconds since unix epoch)
  - ts-syslog        ("Jan 02 15:04:05", parsed time is set to the current year)
  - ts-"CUSTOM"

CUSTOM time layouts must be within quotes and be the representation of the
"reference time", which is `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006`.
To match a comma decimal point you can use a period.  For example `%{TIMESTAMP:timestamp:ts-"2006-01-02 15:04:05.000"}` can be used to match `"2018-01-02 15:04:05,000"`
To match a comma decimal point you can use a period in the pattern string.
See https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse for more details.

Telegraf has many of its own [built-in patterns](./grok/patterns/influx-patterns),
as well as support for most of
[logstash's builtin patterns](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/blob/master/patterns/grok-patterns).
_Golang regular expressions do not support lookahead or lookbehind.
logstash patterns that depend on these are not supported._

If you need help building patterns to match your logs,
you will find the https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com application quite useful!

#### Grok Configuration:
```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  ## Files to parse each interval.
  ## These accept standard unix glob matching rules, but with the addition of
  ## ** as a "super asterisk". ie:
  ##   /var/log/**.log     -> recursively find all .log files in /var/log
  ##   /var/log/*/*.log    -> find all .log files with a parent dir in /var/log
  ##   /var/log/apache.log -> only tail the apache log file
  files = ["/var/log/apache/access.log"]

  ## The dataformat to be read from files
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "grok"

  ## This is a list of patterns to check the given log file(s) for.
  ## Note that adding patterns here increases processing time. The most
  ## efficient configuration is to have one pattern.
  ## Other common built-in patterns are:
  ##   %{COMMON_LOG_FORMAT}   (plain apache & nginx access logs)
  ##   %{COMBINED_LOG_FORMAT} (access logs + referrer & agent)
  grok_patterns = ["%{COMBINED_LOG_FORMAT}"]

  ## Full path(s) to custom pattern files.
  grok_custom_pattern_files = []

  ## Custom patterns can also be defined here. Put one pattern per line.
  grok_custom_patterns = '''
  '''

  ## Timezone allows you to provide an override for timestamps that
  ## don't already include an offset
  ## e.g. 04/06/2016 12:41:45 data one two 5.43µs
  ##
  ## Default: "" which renders UTC
  ## Options are as follows:
  ##   1. Local             -- interpret based on machine localtime
  ##   2. "Canada/Eastern"  -- Unix TZ values like those found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
  ##   3. UTC               -- or blank/unspecified, will return timestamp in UTC
  grok_timezone = "Canada/Eastern"
```

#### Timestamp Examples

This example input and config parses a file using a custom timestamp conversion:

```
2017-02-21 13:10:34 value=42
```

```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  grok_patterns = ['%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp:ts-"2006-01-02 15:04:05"} value=%{NUMBER:value:int}']
```

This example input and config parses a file using a timestamp in unix time:

```
1466004605 value=42
1466004605.123456789 value=42
```

```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  grok_patterns = ['%{NUMBER:timestamp:ts-epoch} value=%{NUMBER:value:int}']
```

This example parses a file using a built-in conversion and a custom pattern:

```
Wed Apr 12 13:10:34 PST 2017 value=42
```

```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  grok_patterns = ["%{TS_UNIX:timestamp:ts-unix} value=%{NUMBER:value:int}"]
  grok_custom_patterns = '''
    TS_UNIX %{DAY} %{MONTH} %{MONTHDAY} %{HOUR}:%{MINUTE}:%{SECOND} %{TZ} %{YEAR}
  '''
```

For cases where the timestamp itself is without offset, the `timezone` config var is available
to denote an offset. By default (with `timezone` either omit, blank or set to `"UTC"`), the times
are processed as if in the UTC timezone. If specified as `timezone = "Local"`, the timestamp
will be processed based on the current machine timezone configuration. Lastly, if using a
timezone from the list of Unix [timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones),
grok will offset the timestamp accordingly.

#### TOML Escaping

When saving patterns to the configuration file, keep in mind the different TOML
[string](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#string) types and the escaping
rules for each.  These escaping rules must be applied in addition to the
escaping required by the grok syntax.  Using the Multi-line line literal
syntax with `'''` may be useful.

The following config examples will parse this input file:

```
|42|\uD83D\uDC2F|'telegraf'|
```

Since `|` is a special character in the grok language, we must escape it to
get a literal `|`.  With a basic TOML string, special characters such as
backslash must be escaped, requiring us to escape the backslash a second time.

```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  grok_patterns = ["\\|%{NUMBER:value:int}\\|%{UNICODE_ESCAPE:escape}\\|'%{WORD:name}'\\|"]
  grok_custom_patterns = "UNICODE_ESCAPE (?:\\\\u[0-9A-F]{4})+"
```

We cannot use a literal TOML string for the pattern, because we cannot match a
`'` within it.  However, it works well for the custom pattern.
```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  grok_patterns = ["\\|%{NUMBER:value:int}\\|%{UNICODE_ESCAPE:escape}\\|'%{WORD:name}'\\|"]
  grok_custom_patterns = 'UNICODE_ESCAPE (?:\\u[0-9A-F]{4})+'
```

A multi-line literal string allows us to encode the pattern:
```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  grok_patterns = ['''
    \|%{NUMBER:value:int}\|%{UNICODE_ESCAPE:escape}\|'%{WORD:name}'\|
  ''']
  grok_custom_patterns = 'UNICODE_ESCAPE (?:\\u[0-9A-F]{4})+'
```

#### Tips for creating patterns

Writing complex patterns can be difficult, here is some advice for writing a
new pattern or testing a pattern developed [online](https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com).

Create a file output that writes to stdout, and disable other outputs while
testing.  This will allow you to see the captured metrics.  Keep in mind that
the file output will only print once per `flush_interval`.

```toml
[[outputs.file]]
  files = ["stdout"]
```

- Start with a file containing only a single line of your input.
- Remove all but the first token or piece of the line.
- Add the section of your pattern to match this piece to your configuration file.
- Verify that the metric is parsed successfully by running Telegraf.
- If successful, add the next token, update the pattern and retest.
- Continue one token at a time until the entire line is successfully parsed.

# Logfmt
This parser implements the logfmt format by extracting and converting key-value pairs from log text in the form `<key>=<value>`.
At the moment, the plugin will produce one metric per line and all keys
are added as fields.
A typical log
```
method=GET host=influxdata.org ts=2018-07-24T19:43:40.275Z
connect=4ms service=8ms status=200 bytes=1653
```
will be converted into
```
logfmt method="GET",host="influxdata.org",ts="2018-07-24T19:43:40.275Z",connect="4ms",service="8ms",status=200i,bytes=1653i

```
Additional information about the logfmt format can be found [here](https://brandur.org/logfmt).

# Wavefront:

Wavefront Data Format is metrics are parsed directly into Telegraf metrics.
For more information about the Wavefront Data Format see
[here](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_data_format.html).

There are no additional configuration options for Wavefront Data Format line-protocol.

#### Wavefront Configuration:

```toml
[[inputs.exec]]
  ## Commands array
  commands = ["/tmp/test.sh", "/usr/bin/mycollector --foo=bar"]

  ## measurement name suffix (for separating different commands)
  name_suffix = "_mycollector"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "wavefront"
```

# CSV
Parse out metrics from a CSV formatted table. By default, the parser assumes there is no header and
will read data from the first line. If `csv_header_row_count` is set to anything besides 0, the parser
will extract column names from the first number of rows. Headers of more than 1 row will have their
names concatenated together.  Any unnamed columns will be ignored by the parser.

The `csv_skip_rows` config indicates the number of rows to skip before looking for header information or data
to parse. By default, no rows will be skipped.

The `csv_skip_columns` config indicates the number of columns to be skipped before parsing data. These
columns will not be read out of the header.  Naming with the `csv_column_names` will begin at the first
parsed column after skipping the indicated columns.  By default, no columns are skipped.

To assign custom column names, the `csv_column_names` config is available. If the `csv_column_names`
config is used, all columns must be named as additional columns will be ignored. If `csv_header_row_count`
is set to 0, `csv_column_names` must be specified.  Names listed in `csv_column_names` will override names extracted
from the header.

The `csv_tag_columns` and `csv_field_columns` configs are available to add the column data to the metric.
The name used to specify the column is the name in the header, or if specified, the corresponding
name assigned in `csv_column_names`. If neither config is specified, no data will be added to the metric.

Additional configs are available to dynamically name metrics and set custom timestamps.  If the
`csv_column_names` config is specified, the parser will assign the metric name to the value found
in that column. If the `csv_timestamp_column` is specified, the parser will extract the timestamp from
that column. If `csv_timestamp_column` is specified, the `csv_timestamp_format` must also be specified
or an error will be thrown.

#### CSV Configuration
```toml
  data_format = "csv"

  ## Indicates how many rows to treat as a header. By default, the parser assumes
  ## there is no header and will parse the first row as data. If set to anything more
  ## than 1, column names will be concatenated with the name listed in the next header row.
  ## If `csv_column_names` is specified, the column names in header will be overridden.
  # csv_header_row_count = 0

  ## Indicates the number of rows to skip before looking for header information.
  # csv_skip_rows = 0

  ## Indicates the number of columns to skip before looking for data to parse.
  ## These columns will be skipped in the header as well.
  # csv_skip_columns = 0

  ## The seperator between csv fields
  ## By default, the parser assumes a comma (",")
  # csv_delimiter = ","

  ## The character reserved for marking a row as a comment row
  ## Commented rows are skipped and not parsed
  # csv_comment = ""

  ## If set to true, the parser will remove leading whitespace from fields
  ## By default, this is false
  # csv_trim_space = false

  ## For assigning custom names to columns
  ## If this is specified, all columns should have a name
  ## Unnamed columns will be ignored by the parser.
  ## If `csv_header_row_count` is set to 0, this config must be used
  csv_column_names = []

  ## Columns listed here will be added as tags. Any other columns
  ## will be added as fields.
  csv_tag_columns = []

  ## The column to extract the name of the metric from
  ## By default, this is the name of the plugin
  ## the `name_override` config overrides this
  # csv_measurement_column = ""

  ## The column to extract time information for the metric
  ## `csv_timestamp_format` must be specified if this is used
  # csv_timestamp_column = ""

  ## The format of time data extracted from `csv_timestamp_column`
  ## this must be specified if `csv_timestamp_column` is specified
  # csv_timestamp_format = ""
  ```
