# Labels

This page describes the meaning of the various
[labels](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/labels) we use on the Github
issue tracker.

## Categories

New issues are automatically labeled `feature request`, `bug`, or `support`.
If you are unsure what problem the author is proposing, you can use the `need more info` label
and if there is another issue you can add the `closed/duplicate` label and close the
new issue.

New pull requests are usually labeled one of `enhancement`, `bugfix` or `new
plugin`.

## Additional Labels

Apply any of the `area/*` labels that match.  If an area doesn't exist, new
ones can be added but **it is not a goal to have an area for all issues.**

If the issue only applies to one platform, you can use a `platform/*` label.
These are only applied to single platform issues which are not on Linux.

For bugs you may want to add `panic`, `regression`, or `upstream` to provide
further detail.
