# Telegraf configuration

# If this file is missing an [agent] section, you must first generate a
# valid config with 'telegraf -sample-config > telegraf.toml'

# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared plugins.

# Even if a plugin has no configuration, it must be declared in here
# to be active. Declaring a plugin means just specifying the name
# as a section with no variables. To deactivate a plugin, comment
# out the name and any variables.

# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.toml -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.

# One rule that plugins conform to is wherever a connection string
# can be passed, the values '' and 'localhost' are treated specially.
# They indicate to the plugin to use their own builtin configuration to
# connect to the local system.

# NOTE: The configuration has a few required parameters. They are marked
# with 'required'. Be sure to edit those to make this configuration work.

[influxdb]

# Connection timeout (for the connection with InfluxDB), formatted as a string.
