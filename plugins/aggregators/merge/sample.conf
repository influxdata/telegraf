# Merge metrics into multifield metrics by series key
[[aggregators.merge]]
  ## General Aggregator Arguments:
  ## The period on which to flush & clear the aggregator.
  # period = "30s"

  ## Precision to round the metric timestamp to
  ## This is useful for cases where metrics to merge arrive within a small
  ## interval and thus vary in timestamp. The timestamp of the resulting metric
  ## is also rounded.
  # round_timestamp_to = "1ns"

  ## If true, the original metric will be dropped by the
  ## aggregator and will not get sent to the output plugins.
  drop_original = true
