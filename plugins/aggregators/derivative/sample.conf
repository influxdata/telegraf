# Calculates a derivative for every field.
[[aggregators.derivative]]
  ## The period in which to flush the aggregator.
  period = "30s"
  ##
  ## Suffix to append for the resulting derivative field.
  # suffix = "_rate"
  ##
  ## Field to use for the quotient when computing the derivative.
  ## When using a field as the derivation parameter the name of that field will
  ## be used for the resulting derivative, e.g. *fieldname_by_parameter*.
  ## By default the timestamps of the metrics are used and the suffix is omitted.
  # variable = ""
  ##
  ## Maximum number of roll-overs in case only one measurement is found during a period.
  # max_roll_over = 10
