# MessagePack:

MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. 

https://msgpack.org

### Format Definitions:

Output of this format is MessagePack binary representation of metrics that have identical structure of the below JSON.

```
{
   "name":"cpu",
   "time": <TIMESTAMP>, // https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#timestamp-extension-type
   "tags":{
      "tag_1":"host01",
      ...
   },
   "fields":{
      "field_1":30,
      "field_2":true,
      "field_3":"field_value"
      "field_4":30.1
      ...
   }
}
```

MessagePack has it's own timestamp representation. You can find additional informations from [MessagePack specification](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#timestamp-extension-type).
