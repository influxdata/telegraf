# Send telegraf metrics to Inlong
[[outputs.inlong]]
  ## From the Inlong system, data streams group, it contains multiple data streams, and one Group represents
  ## one data business unit.
  group_id = "test_group"

  ## From the Inlong system, data stream, a stream has a specific data source, data format and data sink.
  stream_id = "test_stream"

  ## The URL used to obtain the Inlong DataProxy IP list to which the data will be sent
  manager_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8083"

  ## Data format to output.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
  ## Suggest using CSV format here, as Inlong is also processed in CSV format
  data_format = "csv"

  ## The delimiter used when serializing data in CSV format needs to be consistent with the delimiter
  ## configured for Inlong, so that the data can be parsed properly after it reaches Inlong.
  ## It can be a space, vertical bar (|), comma (,), semicolon (;), asterisk (*), double quotes ("), etc.
  csv_separator = "|"

  ## The final output field order here needs to be consistent with the field order defined by the data
  ## stream in Inlong
  csv_columns = ["field.key","file.value"]
