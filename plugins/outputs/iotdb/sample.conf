# Save metrics to an IoTDB Database
[[outputs.iotdb]]
  ## Configuration of IoTDB server connection
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  # port = "6667"

  ## Configuration of authentication
  user = "root"
  password = "root"

  ## Timeout to open a new session.
  ## A value of zero means no timeout.
  #  timeout = "5s"
  timeout = 5000

  ## Configuration of type conversion for 64-bit unsigned int
  ## IoTDB currently DOES NOT support unsigned integers (version 13.x). 
  ## 32-bit unsigned integers are safely converted into 64-bit signed integers by the plugin,
  ## however, this is not true for 64-bit values in general as overflows may occur.
  ## The following option allows to specify the handling of 64-bit unsigned integers.
  ## Available options are:
  ##   - "int64"       --  convert to 64-bit signed integers and accept overflows
  ##   - "int64_clip"  --  convert to 64-bit signed integers and clip the values on overflow to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  ##   - "text"        --  convert to the string representation of the value
  # uint64_conversion = "int64_clip"

  ## Configuration of TimeStamp
  ## TimeStamp is always saved in 64bits int. timestamp_precision specifies the unit of timestamp. 
  ## Available value:
  ## "second", "millisecond", "microsecond", "nanosecond"(defualt)
  # timestamp_precision = "nanosecond"

  ## Handling of tags
  ## Tags are not fully supported by IoTDB. 
  ## A guide with suggestions on how to handle tags can be found here:
  ##     https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/API/InfluxDB-Protocol.html
  ## 
  ## Available methods are:
  ##   - "fields"     --  convert tags to fields in the measurement
  ##   - "device_id"  --  attach tags to the device ID
  ##
  ## For Example, a metric named "root.sg.device" with the tags `tag1: "private"`  and  `tag2: "working"` and
  ##  fields `s1: 100`  and `s2: "hello"` will result in the following representations in IoTDB
  ##   - "fields"     --  root.sg.device, s1=100, s2="hello", tag1="private", tag2="working"
  ##   - "device_id"  --  root.sg.device.private.working, s1=100, s2="hello"
  # convert_tags_to = "device_id"
