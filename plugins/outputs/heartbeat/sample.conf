# A plugin that can transmit heartbeats over HTTP
[[outputs.heartbeat]]
  ## URL of heartbeat endpoint
  url = "http://monitoring.example.com/heartbeat"

  ## Unique identifier to submit for the Telegraf instance (required)
  instance_id = "agent-123"

  ## Token for bearer authentication
  # token = ""

  ## Interval for sending heartbeat messages
  # interval = "1m"

  ## Information to include in the message, available options are
  ##   hostname   -- hostname of the instance running Telegraf
  ##   statistics -- number of metrics, logged errors and warnings, etc
  ##   configs    -- redacted list of configs loaded by this instance
  ##   logs       -- detailed log-entries for this instance
  ##   status     -- result of the status condition evaluation
  # include = ["hostname", "status"]

  ## Logging information filtering, only applies if "logs" is added to "include"
  # [outputs.heartbeat.logs]
  #   ## Number of log entries to send (unlimited by default)
  #   ## In case more log-entries are available entires with higher log levels
  #   ## and more recent entires are preferred.
  #   # limit = 0
  #
  #   ## Minimum log-level for sending the entry
  #   # level = "error"

  ## Logical conditions to determine the agent status, only applies if "status"
  ## is included in the message
  # [outputs.heartbeat.status]
  #   ## Conditions to signal the given status as CEL programs returning a
  #   ## boolean. Conditions are evaluated in the order below until a program
  #   ## evaluates to "true".
  #   # ok = "false"
  #   # warn = "false"
  #   # fail = "false"
  #
  #   ## Evaluation order of the conditions above; available: "ok", "warn", "fail"
  #   # order = ["ok", "warn", "fail"]
  #
  #   ## Default status used if none of the conditions above matches
  #   ## available: "ok", "warn", "fail", "undefined"
  #   # default = "ok"
  #
  #   ## If set, send this initial status before the first write, otherwise
  #   ## compute the status from the conditions and default above.
  #   ## available: "ok", "warn", "fail", "undefined", ""
  #   # initial = ""

  ## Additional HTTP headers
