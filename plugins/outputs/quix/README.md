## Quix Authentication

This plugin uses a SDK token for authentication with Quix. You can generate
one in the settings under the `API and tokens` section by clicking on 
`SDK Token`.

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.
