# A plugin that can transmit metrics over HTTP
[[outputs.http]]
  ## URL is the address to send metrics to
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/telegraf"

  ## HTTP method, one of: "POST" or "PUT" or "PATCH"
  # method = "POST"

  ## HTTP Basic Auth credentials
  # username = "username"
  # password = "pa$$word"

  ## Goole API Auth
  # google_application_credentials = "/etc/telegraf/example_secret.json"

{{template "/plugins/common/http/client.conf"}}

  ## Data format to output.
  ## Each data format has it's own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
  # data_format = "influx"

  ## Use batch serialization format (default) instead of line based format.
  ## Batch format is more efficient and should be used unless line based
  ## format is really needed.
  # use_batch_format = true

  ## HTTP Content-Encoding for write request body, can be set to "gzip" to
  ## compress body or "identity" to apply no encoding.
  # content_encoding = "identity"

  ## Amazon Region
  #region = "us-east-1"

  ## Amazon Credentials
  ## Amazon Credentials are not built unless the following aws_service
  ## setting is set to a non-empty string. It may need to match the name of
  ## the service output to as well
  #aws_service = "execute-api"

  ## Credentials are loaded in the following order
  ## 1) Web identity provider credentials via STS if role_arn and web_identity_token_file are specified
  ## 2) Assumed credentials via STS if role_arn is specified
  ## 3) explicit credentials from 'access_key' and 'secret_key'
  ## 4) shared profile from 'profile'
  ## 5) environment variables
  ## 6) shared credentials file
  ## 7) EC2 Instance Profile
  #access_key = ""
  #secret_key = ""
  #token = ""
  #role_arn = ""
  #web_identity_token_file = ""
  #role_session_name = ""
  #profile = ""
  #shared_credential_file = ""

  ## Optional list of statuscodes (<200 or >300) upon which requests should not be retried
  # non_retryable_statuscodes = [409, 413]

  ## NOTE: Due to the way TOML is parsed, tables must be at the END of the
  ## plugin definition, otherwise additional config options are read as part of
  ## the table

  ## Additional HTTP headers
  # [outputs.http.headers]
  #   ## Should be set manually to "application/json" for json data_format
  #   Content-Type = "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
