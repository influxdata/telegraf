# Configuration for sending metrics to InfluxDB 2.0
[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
  ## The URLs of the InfluxDB cluster nodes.
  ##
  ## Multiple URLs can be specified for a single cluster, only ONE of the
  ## urls will be written to each interval.
  ##   ex: urls = ["https://us-west-2-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com"]
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8086"]

  ## Token for authentication.
  token = ""

  ## Organization is the name of the organization you wish to write to.
  organization = ""

  ## Destination bucket to write into.
  bucket = ""

  ## The value of this tag will be used to determine the bucket.  If this
  ## tag is not set the 'bucket' option is used as the default.
  # bucket_tag = ""

  ## If true, the bucket tag will not be added to the metric.
  # exclude_bucket_tag = false

  ## Timeout for HTTP messages.
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Additional HTTP headers
  # http_headers = {"X-Special-Header" = "Special-Value"}

  ## HTTP Proxy override, if unset values the standard proxy environment
  ## variables are consulted to determine which proxy, if any, should be used.
  # http_proxy = "http://corporate.proxy:3128"

  ## HTTP User-Agent
  # user_agent = "telegraf"

  ## Content-Encoding for write request body, can be set to "gzip" to
  ## compress body or "identity" to apply no encoding.
  # content_encoding = "gzip"

  # influx_uint_support = false

  ## HTTP/2 Timeouts
  ## The following values control the HTTP/2 client's timeouts. These settings
  ## are generally not required unless a user is seeing issues with client
  ## disconnects. If a user does see issues, then it is suggested to set these
  ## values to "15s" for ping timeout and "30s" for read idle timeout and
  ## retry.
  ##
  ## Note that the timer for read_idle_timeout begins at the end of the last
  ## successful write and not at the beginning of the next write.
  # ping_timeout = "0s"
  # read_idle_timeout = "0s"

  ## Optional TLS Config for use on HTTP connections.
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
