# Run executable as long-running output plugin
[[outputs.execd]]
  ## One program to run as daemon.
  ## NOTE: process and each argument should each be their own string
  command = ["my-telegraf-output", "--some-flag", "value"]

  ## Environment variables
  ## Array of "key=value" pairs to pass as environment variables
  ## e.g. "KEY=value", "USERNAME=John Doe",
  ## "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/custom/lib64:/usr/local/libs"
  # environment = []

  ## Delay before the process is restarted after an unexpected termination
  restart_delay = "10s"

  ## Flag to determine whether execd should throw error when part of metrics is unserializable
  ## Setting this to true will skip the unserializable metrics and process the rest of metrics
  ## Setting this to false will throw error when encountering unserializable metrics and none will be processed
  ## This setting does not apply when use_batch_format is set.
  # ignore_serialization_error = false

  ## Use batch serialization instead of per metric. The batch format allows for the
  ## production of batch output formats and may more efficiently encode and write metrics.
  # use_batch_format = false

  ## Data format to export.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
