# Run executable as long-running output plugin

  ## "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/custom/lib64:/usr/local/libs"
  # environment = []

  ## Delay before the process is restarted after an unexpected termination
  restart_delay = "10s"

  ## Flag to determine whether execd should throw error when part of metrics is unserializable
  ## Setting this to true will skip the unserializable metrics and process the rest of metrics
  ## Setting this to false will throw error when encountering unserializable metrics and none will be processed
  # ignore_serialization_error = false

  ## Data format to export.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
