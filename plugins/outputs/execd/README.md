# Execd Output Plugin

### Configuration:

```toml
[[outputs.execd]]
  ## One program to run as daemon.
  ## NOTE: process and each argument should each be their own string
  command = ["my-telegraf-output", "--some-flag", "value"]

  ## Delay before the process is restarted after an unexpected termination
  restart_delay = "10s"

  ## Data format to export.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
