# Run executable as long-running output plugin
[[outputs.execd]]
  ## One program to run as daemon.
  ## NOTE: process and each argument should each be their own string

  ## Environment variables
  ## Array of "key=value" pairs to pass as environment variables
  ## e.g. "KEY=value", "USERNAME=John Doe",

  # environment = []

  ## Delay before the process is restarted after an unexpected termination
  restart_delay = "10s"
