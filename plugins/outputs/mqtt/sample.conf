# Configuration for MQTT server to send metrics to
[[outputs.mqtt]]
  ## MQTT Brokers
  ## The list of brokers should only include the hostname or IP address and the
  ## port to the broker. This should follow the format `[{scheme}://]{host}:{port}`. For
  ## example, `localhost:1883` or `mqtt://localhost:1883`.
  ## Scheme can be any of the following: tcp://, mqtt://, tls://, mqtts://
  ## non-TLS and TLS servers can not be mix-and-matched.
  servers = ["localhost:1883", ] # or ["mqtts://tls.example.com:1883"]

  ## Protocol can be `3.1.1` or `5`. Default is `3.1.1`
  # procotol = "3.1.1"

  ## MQTT Topic for Producer Messages
  ## MQTT outputs send metrics to this topic format:
  ## {{ .TopicPrefix }}/{{ .Hostname }}/{{ .PluginName }}/{{ .Tag "tag_key" }}
  ## (e.g. prefix/web01.example.com/mem/some_tag_value)
  ## Each path segment accepts either a template placeholder, an environment variable, or a tag key
  ## of the form `{{.Tag "tag_key_name"}}`. Empty path elements as well as special MQTT characters
  ## (such as `+` or `#`) are invalid to form the topic name and will lead to an error.
  ## In case a tag is missing in the metric, that path segment omitted for the final topic.
  topic = "telegraf/{{ .Hostname }}/{{ .PluginName }}"

  ## QoS policy for messages
  ## The mqtt QoS policy for sending messages.
  ## See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q029090_.htm
  ##   0 = at most once
  ##   1 = at least once
  ##   2 = exactly once
  # qos = 2

  ## Keep Alive
  ## Defines the maximum length of time that the broker and client may not
  ## communicate. Defaults to 0 which turns the feature off.
  ##
  ## For version v2.0.12 and later mosquitto there is a bug
  ## (see https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues/2117), which requires
  ## this to be non-zero. As a reference eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang defaults to 30.
  # keep_alive = 0

  ## username and password to connect MQTT server.
  # username = "telegraf"
  # password = "metricsmetricsmetricsmetrics"

  ## client ID
  ## The unique client id to connect MQTT server. If this parameter is not set
  ## then a random ID is generated.
  # client_id = ""

  ## Timeout for write operations. default: 5s
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"

  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ## When true, metrics will be sent in one MQTT message per flush. Otherwise,
  ## metrics are written one metric per MQTT message.
  ## DEPRECATED: Use layout option instead
  # batch = false

  ## When true, metric will have RETAIN flag set, making broker cache entries until someone
  ## actually reads it
  # retain = false

  ## Layout of the topics published.
  ## The following choices are available:
  ##   non-batch -- send individual messages, one for each metric
  ##   batch     -- send all metric as a single message per MQTT topic
  ## NOTE: The following options will ignore the 'data_format' option and send single values
  ##   field     -- send individual messages for each field, appending its name to the metric topic
  ##   homie-v4  -- send metrics with fields and tags according to the 4.0.0 specs
  ##                see https://homieiot.github.io/specification/
  # layout = "non-batch"

  ## HOMIE specific settings
  ## The following options provide templates for setting the device name
  ## and the node-ID for the topics. Both options are MANDATORY and can contain
  ## {{ .PluginName }} (metric name), {{ .Tag "key"}} (tag reference to 'key')
  ## or constant strings. The templays MAY NOT contain slashes!
  # homie_device_name = ""
  # homie_node_id = ""

  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_OUTPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"

  ## Optional MQTT 5 publish properties
  ## These setting only apply if the "protocol" property is set to 5. This must
  ## be defined at the end of the plugin settings, otherwise TOML will assume
  ## anything else is part of this table. For more details on publish properties
  ## see the spec:
  ## https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901109
  # [outputs.mqtt.v5]
  #   content_type = ""
  #   response_topic = ""
  #   message_expiry = "0s"
  #   topic_alias = 0
  # [outputs.mqtt.v5.user_properties]
  #   "key1" = "value 1"
  #   "key2" = "value 2"
