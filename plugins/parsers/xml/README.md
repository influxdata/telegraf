# XML

The `xml` data format parses data in [XML] format.
This plugin using [etree package](https://github.com/beevik/etree)

### Configuration

```toml
[[inputs.file]]
  files = [ "data.xml" ]

  data_format = "xml"
  ##  xml_query parameter using XPath query for limits the list of analyzed nodes. Default - "//"
  xml_query = "//Node/"
    ##  xml_merge_nodes determines whether all extracted keys will be merged into one metric. Default - false
  xml_merge_nodes = true
    ##  if xml_node_to_tag equals "true", the name of the node is recorded in the tags with the key "node_name". Default - false
  xml_node_to_tag = true
  ## Tag keys is an array of keys that should be added as tags.  Matching keys are no longer saved as fields.
  tag_keys = [
    "my_tag_1",
    "my_tag_2"
  ]
```

#### xml_merge_nodes

This determines whether all extracted keys will be merged into one metric.
For example, if your XML looks like this:
```xml
<VHost>
  <ConnectionsCurrent>0</ConnectionsCurrent>
  <ConnectionsTotal>0</ConnectionsTotal>
</VHost>
```
and **xml_merge_nodes = true**, you will get this metric:
```diff
+ xml ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
```
therwise, each node will be written in a separate row
```diff
+ xml ConnectionsCurrent=0i
+ xml ConnectionsTotal=0i
```

Setting a parameter to false can be useful if your data is combined in one node and declared in its attributes:
```xml
<VHost>
  <Host_1 Name="Host" ConnectionsCurrent="0" ConnectionsTotal="0" />
  <Host_2 Name="Server" ConnectionsCurrent="0" ConnectionsTotal="0" />
</VHost>
```
Output with **xml_merge_nodes = false**:
```diff
+ xml Name="Host",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
+ xml Name="Server",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
```

#### xml_node_to_tag
This parameter determines whether the node name will be added to the tags.
For a previous input example, if **xml_node_to_tag=true**:
```diff
+ xml,node_name=Host_1 Name="Host",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
+ xml,node_name=Host_2 Name="Server",ConnectionsCurrent=0i,ConnectionsTotal=0i
```

### Metrics

If the node or attribute value contains only *\s*, *\t*, *\r* or *\n* characters, it will be discarded.
Each value sequentially passes conversion attempts to Int64, Float64 and Boolean using **strconv**. 
If the conversion was successful, the result of the conversion is written in the field, otherwise a string is returned.
