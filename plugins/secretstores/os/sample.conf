# Operating System native secret-store
[[secretstores.os]]
  ## Unique identifier for the secret-store.
  ## This id can later be used in plugins to reference the secrets
  ## in this secret-store via @{<id>:<secret_key>} (mandatory)
  id = "secretstore"

  ## Keyring Name & Collection
  ## * Linux: keyring name used for the secrets, collection is unused
  ## * macOS: keyring specifies the macOS' Keychain name and collection is an
  ##     optional Keychain service name
  ## * Windows: keys follow a fixed pattern in the form
  ##     `<collection>:<keyring>:<key_name>`. Please keep this in mind when
  ##     creating secrets with the Windows credential tool.
  # keyring = "telegraf"
  # collection = ""

  ## macOS Keychain password
  ## If no password is specified here, Telegraf will prompt for it at startup
  ## time.
  # password = ""

  ## Allow dynamic secrets that are updated during runtime of telegraf
  # dynamic = false
