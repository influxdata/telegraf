# Secret-store to access Docker Secrets
[[secretstores.docker]]
  ## Unique identifier for the secretstore.
  ## This id can later be used in plugins to reference the secrets
  ## in this secret-store via @{<id>:<secret_key>} (mandatory)
  id = "docker_secretstore"

  ## Default Path to directory where docker stores the secrets file
  ## Current implementation in docker compose v2 only allows the following
  ## value for the path where the secrets are mounted at runtime
  # path = "/run/secrets"

  ## Allow dynamic secrets that are updated during runtime of telegraf
  ## Dynamic Secrets work only with `file` or `external` configuration
  ## in `secrets` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file
  # dynamic = false
