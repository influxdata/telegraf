# Docker Secrets Secret-Store Plugin

The `docker` plugin allows to utilize credentials and secrets mounted by
Docker during container runtime. The secrets are mounted as files
under the `/run/secrets` directory within the container.

> NOTE: This plugin can ONLY read the mounted secrets from Docker and NOT set them.

## Configuration

```toml @sample.conf
# Secret-store to access Docker Secrets
[[secretstores.docker]]
  ## Unique identifier for the secretstore.
  ## This id can later be used in plugins to reference the secrets
  ## in this secret-store via @{<id>:<secret_key>} (mandatory)
  id = "docker_secretstore"

  ## Default Path to directory where docker stores the secrets file
  ## Current implementation in docker compose v2 only allows the following
  ## value for the path where the secrets are mounted at runtime
  # path = "/run/secrets"

  ## Allow dynamic secrets that are updated during runtime of telegraf
  ## Dynamic Secrets work only with `file` or `external` configuration
  ## in `secrets` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file
  # dynamic = false
```

Each Secret mentioned within a Compose service's `secrets` parameter will be
available as file under the `/run/secrets/<secret-name>` within the container.

It is possible to let Telegraf pick changed secret values into plugins by setting
`dynamic = true`. This feature will work only for Docker Secrets provided via
`file` and `external` type within the `docker-compose.yml` file
and not when using `environment` type
(Refer here [Docker Secrets in Compose Specification][1]).

## Example Compose File

```yaml
services:
  telegraf:
    image: docker.io/telegraf:latest
    container_name: dockersecret_telegraf
    user: "${USERID}" # Required to access the /run/secrets directory in container
    secrets:
      - secret_for_plugin
    volumes:
      - /path/to/telegrafconf/host:/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf:ro

secrets:
  secret_for_plugin:
    environment: TELEGRAF_PLUGIN_CREDENTIAL
```

here the `TELEGRAF_PLUGIN_CREDENTIAL` exists in a `.env` file in the same directory
as the `docker-compose.yml`. An example of the `.env` file can be as follows:

```env
TELEGRAF_PLUGIN_CREDENTIAL=superSecretStuff
# determine this value by executing `id -u` in terminal
USERID=1000
```

### Referencing Secret within a Plugin

Referencing the secret within a plugin occurs by:

```toml
[[inputs.<some_plugin>]]
  password = "@{docker_secretstore:secret_for_plugin}"
```
