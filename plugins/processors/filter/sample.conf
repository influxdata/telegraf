    ## Rules to apply on the incoming metrics (multiple rules are possible)
    ## The rules are evaluated in order and the first matching rule is applied.
    ## In case no rule matches the "default" is applied.
    ## All filter criteria in a rule must apply for the rule to match the metric.
    ## The criteria are combined by a logical AND. If a criterion is
    ## omitted, it is NOT applied at all and ignored.
