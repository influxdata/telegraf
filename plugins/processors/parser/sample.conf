# Parse a value in a specified field(s)/tag(s) and add the result in a new metric
[[processors.parser]]
  ## The name of the fields whose value will be parsed.
  parse_fields = ["message"]

  ## The name of the tags whose value will be parsed.
  # parse_tags = []

  ## If true, incoming metrics are not emitted.
  # drop_original = false

  ## Merge Behavior
  ## Only has effect when drop_original is set to false. Possible options
  ## include:
  ##  * override: emitted metrics are merged by overriding the original metric
  ##    using the newly parsed metrics, but retains the original metric
  ##    timestamp.
  ##  * override-with-timestamp: the same as "override", but the timestamp is
  ##    set based on the new metrics if present.
  # merge = ""

  ## The dataformat to be read from files
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
