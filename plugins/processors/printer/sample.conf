  ## When true, Telegraf will output unsigned integers as unsigned values,

  ## integer values.  Enabling this option will result in field type errors if
  ## existing data has been written.

  ## When true, Telegraf will omit the timestamp on data to allow InfluxDB
  ## to set the timestamp of the data during ingestion. This is generally NOT
  ## what you want as it can lead to data points captured at different times
  ## getting omitted due to similar data.
  # influx_omit_timestamp = false
