# Rotate multi field metric into several single field metrics
[[processors.unpivot]]
  ## Metric mode to pivot to
  ## Set to "tag", metrics are pivoted as a tag and the metric is kept as
  ## the original measurement name. Tag key name is set by tag_key value.
  ## Set to "metric" creates a new metric named the field name. With this
  ## option the tag_key is ignored. Be aware that this could lead to metric
  ## name conflicts!
  # use_fieldname_as = "tag"

  ## Tag to use for the name.
  # tag_key = "name"

  ## Field to use for the name of the value.
  # value_key = "value"
