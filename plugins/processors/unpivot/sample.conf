# Rotate multi field metric into several single field metrics
[[processors.unpivot]]
  ## Metric mode to pivot to
  ## Set to "original", metrics are pivoted to the original measurement name
  ## Set to "field" creates a new metric called the field name. With this
  ## option the tag_key is ignored. Be aware that this could lead to metric
  ## name conflicts!
  # metric_mode = "original"

  ## Tag to use for the name.
  # tag_key = "name"

  ## Field to use for the name of the value.
  # value_key = "value"
