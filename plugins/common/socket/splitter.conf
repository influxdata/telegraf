  ## Message splitting strategy and corresponding settings for stream sockets
  ## (tcp, tcp4, tcp6, unix or unixpacket). The setting is ignored for packet
  ## listeners such as udp.
  ## Available strategies are:
  ##   newline         -- split at newlines (default)
  ##   null            -- split at null bytes
  ##   delimiter       -- split at delimiter byte-sequence in hex-format
  ##                      given in `splitting_delimiter`
  ##   fixed length    -- split after number of bytes given in `splitting_length`
  ##   variable length -- split depending on length information received in the
  ##                      data. The length field information is specified in
  ##                      `splitting_length_field`.
  # splitting_strategy = "newline"

  ## Delimiter used to split received data to messages consumed by the parser.
  ## The delimiter is a hex byte-sequence marking the end of a message
  ## e.g. "0x0D0A", "x0d0a" or "0d0a" marks a Windows line-break (CR LF).
  ## The value is case-insensitive and can be specified with "0x" or "x" prefix
  ## or without.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "delimiter".
  # splitting_delimiter = ""

  ## Fixed length of a message in bytes.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "fixed length".
  # splitting_length = 0

  ## Specification of the length field contained in the data to split messages
  ## with variable length. The specification contains the following fields:
  ##  offset        -- start of length field in bytes from begin of data
  ##  bytes         -- length of length field in bytes
  ##  endianness    -- endianness of the value, either "be" for big endian or
  ##                   "le" for little endian
  ##  header_length -- total length of header to be skipped when passing
  ##                   data on to the parser. If zero (default), the header
  ##                   is passed on to the parser together with the message.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "variable length".
  # splitting_length_field = {offset = 0, bytes = 0, endianness = "be", header_length = 0}
