  ## Permission for unix sockets (only available on unix sockets)
  ## This setting may not be respected by some platforms. To safely restrict
  ## permissions it is recommended to place the socket into a previously
  ## created directory with the desired permissions.
  ##   ex: socket_mode = "777"
  # socket_mode = ""

  ## Maximum number of concurrent connections (only available on stream sockets like TCP)
  ## Zero means unlimited.
  # max_connections = 0

  ## Read timeout (only available on stream sockets like TCP)
  ## Zero means unlimited.
  # read_timeout = "0s"

  ## Optional TLS configuration (only available on stream sockets like TCP)
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key  = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Enables client authentication if set.
  # tls_allowed_cacerts = ["/etc/telegraf/clientca.pem"]

  ## Maximum socket buffer size (in bytes when no unit specified)
  ## For stream sockets, once the buffer fills up, the sender will start
  ## backing up. For datagram sockets, once the buffer fills up, metrics will
  ## start dropping. Defaults to the OS default.
  # read_buffer_size = "64KiB"

  ## Period between keep alive probes (only applies to TCP sockets)
  ## Zero disables keep alive probes. Defaults to the OS configuration.
  # keep_alive_period = "5m"

  ## Content encoding for message payloads
  ## Can be set to "gzip" for compressed payloads or "identity" for no encoding.
  # content_encoding = "identity"

  ## Maximum size of decoded packet (in bytes when no unit specified)
  # max_decompression_size = "500MB"

  ## List of allowed source IP addresses for incoming packets/messages.
  ## If not specified or empty, all sources are allowed.
  # allowed_sources = []
