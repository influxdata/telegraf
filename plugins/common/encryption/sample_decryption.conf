  ## Cipher to use for decryption.
  ## You can specify variants of the algorithm e.g. AES128/CBC/PKCS#5Padding
  ## using a slash ('/') separator. A list of available ciphers can be found at
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/common/encryption/README.md
  # cipher = "none"

  ## AES cipher parameters
  # [{{.Prefix}}.aes]
  #   ## Key and initialization-vector (IV) for the decryption.
  #   ## In case the key is derived from a password, the `key` can be omitted.
  #   key = ""
  #   init_vector = ""
  #
  #   ## Parameters for password-based-key derivation.
  #   ## These parameters must match the encryption side to derive the same
  #   ## key on both sides!
  #   # kdf_algorithm = "PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256"
  #   password = ""
  #   salt = ""
  #   iterations = 0
