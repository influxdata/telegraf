  ## Path to socket exposed by pf-bb-config for CLI interaction (mandatory).
  ## In version v23.03 of pf-bb-config the path is created according to the schema:

  ## Path to log file exposed by pf-bb-config with telemetry to read (mandatory).
  ## In version v23.03 of pf-bb-config the path is created according to the schema:
  ##   "/var/log/pf_bb_cfg_0000\:<b>\:<d>.<f>.log" where 0000\:<b>\:<d>.<f> is the PCI device ID.

  ## Specifies plugin behavior regarding unreachable socket (which might not have been initialized yet).
  ## Available choices:
  ##   - error: Telegraf will return an error on startup if socket is unreachable
  ##   - ignore: Telegraf will ignore error regarding unreachable socket on both startup and gather
  # unreachable_socket_behavior = "error"

  ## Duration that defines how long the connected socket client will wait for
  ## a response before terminating connection.
  ## Since it's local socket access to a fast packet processing application, the timeout should
  ## be sufficient for most users.
  ## Setting the value to 0 disables the timeout (not recommended).
  # socket_access_timeout = "1s"

  ## Duration that defines maximum time plugin will wait for pf-bb-config to write telemetry to the log file.
  ## Timeout may differ depending on the environment.
  ## Must be equal or larger than 50ms.
  # wait_for_telemetry_timeout = "1s"
