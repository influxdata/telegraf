# Systemd-Units Input Plugin

This plugin gathers the status of systemd-units on Linux, using systemd's DBus
interface.

Please note: At least systemd v230 is required!

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.

[CONFIGURATION.md]: ../../../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#plugins

## Configuration

```toml @sample.conf
# Gather information about systemd-unit states
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux
[[inputs.systemd_units]]
  ## Pattern of units to collect
  ## A space-separated list of unit-patterns including wildcards determining
  ## the units to collect.
  ##  ex: pattern = "telegraf* influxdb* user@*"
  # pattern = "*"

  ## Filter for a specific unit type
  ## Available settings are: service, socket, target, device, mount,
  ## automount, swap, timer, path, slice and scope
  # unittype = "service"

  ## Collect detailed information for the units
  # details = false

  ## Timeout for state-collection
  # timeout = "1s"
```

This plugin supports two modes of operation:

### Non-detailed mode

This is the default mode, collecting data on the unit's status only without
further details on the unit.

### Detailed mode

This mode can be enabled by setting the configuration option `details` to
`true`. In this mode the plugin collects all information of the non-detailed
mode but provides additional unit information such as memory usage,
restart-counts, PID, etc. See the [metrics section](#metrics) below for a list
of all properties collected.

## Metrics

These metrics are available in both modes:

- systemd_units:
  - tags:
    - name (string, unit name)
    - load (string, load state)
    - active (string, active state)
    - sub (string, sub state)
  - fields:
    - load_code (int, see below)
    - active_code (int, see below)
    - sub_code (int, see below)

The following *additional* metrics are available with `details = true`:

- systemd_units:
  - tags:
    - state (string, unit file state)
    - preset (string, unit file preset state)
  - fields:
    - status_errno (int, last error)
    - restarts (int, number of restarts)
    - pid (int, pid of the main process)
    - mem_current (uint, current memory usage)
    - mem_peak (uint, peak memory usage)
    - swap_current (uint, current swap usage)
    - swap_peak (uint, peak swap usage)
    - mem_avail (uint, available memory for this unit)

### Load

enumeration of sub states, see various [unittype_state_tables][3]; duplicates
