# Gather information about systemd-unit states
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux
[[inputs.systemd_units]]
  ## Pattern of units to collect
  ## A space-separated list of unit-patterns including wildcards determining
  ## the units to collect.
  ##  ex: pattern = "telegraf* influxdb* user@*"
  # pattern = "*"

  ## Filter for a specific unit type
  ## Available settings are: service, socket, target, device, mount,
  ## automount, swap, timer, path, slice and scope
  # unittype = "service"

  ## Collect system or user scoped units
  ##  ex: scope = "user"
  # scope = "system"

  ## Collect also units not loaded by systemd (disabled or static units)
  ## Enabling this feature might introduce significant load when used with
  ## unspecific patterns (such as '*') as systemd will need to load all
  ## matching unit files.
  # collect_disabled_units = false

  ## Collect detailed information for the units
  # details = false

  ## Timeout for state-collection
  # timeout = "5s"
