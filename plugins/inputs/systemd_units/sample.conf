# Gather systemd units state
[[inputs.systemd_units]]
  ## Set timeout for systemctl execution
  # timeout = "1s"

  ## Select the systemctl subcommand to use to gather information.
  ## Using `list-units` is the option with the broadest compatibility.
  ## Using `show` will get more information but may fail to list all units on
  ## some systems.
  # subcommand = "list-units"

  ## Filter for a specific unit type, default is "service", other possible
  ## values are "socket", "target", "device", "mount", "automount", "swap",
  ## "timer", "path", "slice" and "scope ":
  # unittype = "service"

  ## Filter for a specific pattern, default is "" (i.e. all), other possible
  ## values are valid pattern for systemctl, e.g. "a*" for all units with
  ## names starting with "a"
  ## pattern = "telegraf* influxdb*"
  ## pattern = "a*"
  # pattern = ""
