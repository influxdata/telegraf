# win_perf_counters readme

This document presents the input plugin to read Performance Counters on Windows operating systems.

The configuration is parsed and then tested for validity, such as
whether the Object, Instance and Counter exist on Telegraf startup.

Counter paths are refreshed periodically, see the [CountersRefreshInterval](#countersrefreshinterval)
configuration parameter for more info.

In case of query for all instances `["*"]`, the plugin does not return the instance `_Total`
by default. See [IncludeTotal](#includetotal) for more info.

## Basics

The examples contained in this file have been found on the internet
as counters used when performance monitoring
 Active Directory and IIS in particular.
 There are a lot of other good objects to monitor, if you know what to look for.
 This file is likely to be updated in the future with more examples for
 useful configurations for separate scenarios.

### Plugin wide

Plugin wide entries are underneath `[[inputs.win_perf_counters]]`.

#### PrintValid

Bool, if set to `true` will print out all matching performance objects.

Example:
`PrintValid=true`

#### UseWildcardsExpansion

If `UseWildcardsExpansion` is set to true, wildcards can be used in the
instance name and the counter name.  When using localized Windows, counters
will be also be localized.  Instance indexes will also be returned in the
instance name.

Partial wildcards (e.g. `chrome*`) are supported only in the instance name on Windows Vista and newer.

If disabled, wildcards (not partial) in instance names can still be used, but
instance indexes will not be returned in the instance names.

Example:
`UseWildcardsExpansion=true`

#### CountersRefreshInterval

Configured counters are matched against available counters at the interval
specified by the `CountersRefreshInterval` parameter. The default value is `1m` (1 minute).

If wildcards are used in instance or counter names, they are expanded at this point, if the `UseWildcardsExpansion` param is set to `true`.

Setting the `CountersRefreshInterval` too low (order of seconds) can cause Telegraf to create
a high CPU load.

Set it to `0s` to disable periodic refreshing.

Example:
`CountersRefreshInterval=1m`

#### PreVistaSupport

_Deprecated. Necessary features on Windows Vista and newer are checked dynamically_

Bool, if set to `true`, the plugin will use the localized PerfCounter interface that has been present since before Vista for backwards compatability.

It is recommended NOT to use this on OSes starting with Vista and newer because it requires more configuration to use this than the newer interface present since Vista.

Example for Windows Server 2003, this would be set to true:
`PreVistaSupport=true`

#### UsePerfCounterTime

Bool, if set to `true` will request a timestamp along with the PerfCounter data. 
If se to `false`, current time will be used.

Supported on Windows Vista/Windows Server 2008 and newer
Example:
`UsePerfCounterTime=true`

### Object

See Entry below.

### Entry
A new configuration entry consists of the TOML header starting with,
`[[inputs.win_perf_counters.object]]`.
This must follow before other plugin configurations,
beneath the main win_perf_counters entry, `[[inputs.win_perf_counters]]`.

Following this are 3 required key/value pairs and three optional parameters and their usage.

#### ObjectName
**Required**

ObjectName is the Object to query for, like Processor, DirectoryServices, LogicalDisk or similar.

Example: `ObjectName = "LogicalDisk"`

#### Instances
**Required**

The instances key (this is an array) declares the instances of a counter you would like returned,
it can be one or more values.

Example: `Instances = ["C:","D:","E:"]`

This will return only for the instances
C:, D: and E: where relevant. To get all instances of a Counter, use `["*"]` only.
By default any results containing `_Total` are stripped,
unless this is specified as the wanted instance.
Alternatively see the option `IncludeTotal` below.

It is also possible to set partial wildcards, eg. `["chrome*"]`, if the `UseWildcardsExpansion` param is set to `true`

Some Objects do not have instances to select from at all.
Here only one option is valid if you want data back,
and that is to specify `Instances = ["------"]`.

#### Counters
**Required**

The Counters key (this is an array) declares the counters of the ObjectName
you would like returned, it can also be one or more values.

Example: `Counters = ["% Idle Time", "% Disk Read Time", "% Disk Write Time"]`

This must be specified for every counter you want the results of, or use
`["*"]` for all the counters of the object, if the `UseWildcardsExpansion` param
is set to `true`.

#### Measurement
*Optional*

This key is optional. If it is not set it will be `win_perf_counters`.
In InfluxDB this is the key underneath which the returned data is stored.
So for ordering your data in a good manner,
this is a good key to set with a value when you want your IIS and Disk results stored
separately from Processor results.

Example: `Measurement = "win_disk"``

#### IncludeTotal
*Optional*

This key is optional. It is a simple bool.
If it is not set to true or included it is treated as false.
This key only has effect if the Instances key is set to `["*"]`
and you would also like all instances containing `_Total` to be returned,
like `_Total`, `0,_Total` and so on where applicable
(Processor Information is one example).

#### WarnOnMissing
*Optional*

This key is optional. It is a simple bool.
If it is not set to true or included it is treated as false.
This only has effect on the first execution of the plugin.
It will print out any ObjectName/Instance/Counter combinations
asked for that do not match. Useful when debugging new configurations.

#### FailOnMissing
*Internal*

This key should not be used. It is for testing purposes only.
It is a simple bool. If it is not set to true or included this is treated as false.
If this is set to true, the plugin will abort and end prematurely
if any of the combinations of ObjectName/Instances/Counters are invalid.

## Troubleshooting

If you are getting an error about an invalid counter, use the `typeperf` command to check the counter path
on the command line.
E.g. `typeperf "Process(chrome*)\% Processor Time"`

If no metrics are emitted even with the default config, you may need to repair
your performance counters.

1. Launch the Command Prompt as Administrator (right click Runs As Administrator).
1. Drop into the C:\WINDOWS\System32 directory by typing `C:` then `cd \Windows\System32`
1. Rebuild your counter values, which may take a few moments so please be
   patient, by running:
   ```
   lodctr /r
   ```
