# Input plugin to counterPath Performance Counters on Windows operating systems
# This plugin ONLY supports Windows
[[inputs.win_perf_counters]]
  ## By default this plugin returns basic CPU and Disk statistics. See the
  ## README file for more examples. Uncomment examples below or write your own
  ## as you see fit. If the system being polled for data does not have the
  ## Object at startup of the Telegraf agent, it will not be gathered.

  ## Print All matching performance counters
  # PrintValid = false

  ## Whether request a timestamp along with the PerfCounter data or use current
  ## time
  # UsePerfCounterTime = true

  ## If UseWildcardsExpansion params is set to true, wildcards (partial
  ## wildcards in instance names and wildcards in counters names) in configured
  ## counter paths will be expanded and in case of localized Windows, counter
  ## paths will be also localized. It also returns instance indexes in instance
  ## names. If false, wildcards (not partial) in instance names will still be
  ## expanded, but instance indexes will not be returned in instance names.
  # UseWildcardsExpansion = false

  ## When running on a localized version of Windows and with
  ## UseWildcardsExpansion = true, Windows will localize object and counter
  ## names. When LocalizeWildcardsExpansion = false, use the names in
  ## object.Counters instead of the localized names. Only Instances can have
  ## wildcards in this case. ObjectName and Counters must not have wildcards
  ## when this setting is false.
  # LocalizeWildcardsExpansion = true

  ## Period after which counters will be reread from configuration and
  ## wildcards in counter paths expanded
  # CountersRefreshInterval="1m"

  ## Accepts a list of PDH error codes which are defined in pdh.go, if this
  ## error is encountered it will be ignored. For example, you can provide
  ## "PDH_NO_DATA" to ignore performance counters with no instances. By default
  ## no errors are ignored You can find the list here:
  ##   https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters/pdh.go
  ## e.g. IgnoredErrors = ["PDH_NO_DATA"]
  # IgnoredErrors = []

  ## NOTE: Due to the way TOML is parsed, tables must be at the END of the
  ## plugin definition, otherwise additional config options are read as part of
  ## the table

  # [[inputs.win_perf_counters.object]]
    # Measurement = ""
    # ObjectName = ""
    # Instances = [""]
    # Counters = []
    ## Additional Object Settings
    ##   * IncludeTotal: set to true to include _Total instance when querying
    ##                   for all metrics via '*'
    ##   * WarnOnMissing: print out when the performance counter is missing
    ##                    from object, counter or instance
    ##   * UseRawValues: gather raw values instead of formatted. Raw values are
    ##                   stored in the field name with the "_Raw" suffix, e.g.
    ##                   "Disk_Read_Bytes_sec_Raw".
    # IncludeTotal = false
    # WarnOnMissing = false
    # UseRawValues = false
