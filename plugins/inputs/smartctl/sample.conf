# Read metrics from SMART storage devices using smartclt's JSON output
[[inputs.smartctl]]
    ## Optionally specify the path to the smartctl executable
    # path = "/usr/sbin/smartctl"

    ## Use sudo
    ## On most platforms used, smartctl requires root access. Setting 'use_sudo'
    ## to true will make use of sudo to run smartctl. Sudo must be configured to
    ## allow the telegraf user to run smartctl without a password.
    # use_sudo = false

    ## Devices to include or exclude
    ## By default, the plugin will use all devices found in the output of
    ## `smartctl --scan-open`. Only one option is allowed at a time. If set, include
    ## sets the specific devices to scan, while exclude omits specific devices.
    # devices_include = []
    # devices_exclude = []

    ## Skip checking disks in specified power mode
    ## Defaults to "standby" to not wake up disks that have stopped rotating.
    ## For full details on the options here, see the --nocheck section in the
    ## smartctl man page. Choose from:
    ##   * never: always check the device
    ##   * sleep: check the device unless it is in sleep mode
    ##   * standby: check the device unless it is in sleep or standby mode
    ##   * idle: check the device unless it is in sleep, standby, or idle mode
    # nocheck = "standby"

    ## Timeout for the cli command to complete
    # timeout = "30s"
