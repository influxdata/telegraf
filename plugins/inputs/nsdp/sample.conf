# Gather NSDP (Netgear Switch Discovery Protocol) status
[[inputs.nsdp]]
  ## The target address to use for NSDP gathering the status.
  # target = "255.255.255.255:63322"

  ## The maximum number of device responses to wait for. 0 means no limit.
  ## NSDP works asynchronously. Without a limit (0) the plugin always waits
  ## the amount given in timeout for possible responses. By setting this
  ## option to the known number of devices, the plugin completes
  ## processing as soon as the last device has answered.
  # device_limit = 0

  ## The maximum duration to wait for device responses.
  # timeout = "2s"
