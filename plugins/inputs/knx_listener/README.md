# KNX input plugin

The KNX input plugin that listens for messages on the KNX home-automation bus.
This plugin connects to the KNX bus via a KNX-IP interface.
Information about supported KNX message datapoint types can be found at the
underlying "knx-go" project site (https://github.com/vapourismo/knx-go).

### Configuration

This is a sample config for the plugin.

```toml
# Listener capable of handling KNX bus messages provided through a KNX-IP Interface.
[[inputs.KNXListener]]
  ## Type of KNX-IP interface.
  ## Can be either "tunnel" or "router".
  # service_type = "tunnel"

  ## Address of the KNX-IP interface.
  service_address = "localhost:3671"

  ## Measurement definition(s)
  # [[inputs.KNXListener.measurement]]
  #   ## Name of the measurement
  #   name = "temperature"
  #   ## Datapoint-Type (DPT) of the KNX messages
  #   dpt = "9.001"
  #   ## List of Group-Addresses (GAs) assigned to the measurement
  #   addresses = ["5/5/1"]

  # [[inputs.KNXListener.measurement]]
  #   name = "illumination"
  #   dpt = "9.004"
  #   addresses = ["5/5/3"]
```

#### Measurement configurations

Each measurement contains only one datapoint-type (DPT) and assigns a list of
addresses to this measurement. You can, for example group all temperature sensor
messages within a "temperature" measurement. However, you are free to split
messages of one datapoint-type to multiple measurements.

**NOTE: You should not assign a group-address (GA) to multiple measurements!**

### Metrics

Received KNX data is stored in the named measurement as configured above using
the "value" field. Additional to the value, there are the following tags added
to the datapoint:
  - "groupaddress": KNX group-address corresponding to the value
  - "unit":         unit of the value
  - "source":       KNX physical address sending the value

To find out about the datatype of the datapoint please check your KNX project,
the KNX-specification or the "knx-go" project for the corresponding DPT.
