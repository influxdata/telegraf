# OpenWeatherMap Input Plugin

Collect current weather and forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.

To use this plugin you will need an [api key][] (app_id).

City identifiers can be found in the [city list][]. Alternately you
can [search][] by name; the `city_id` can be found as the last digits
of the URL: <https://openweathermap.org/city/2643743>. Language
identifiers can be found in the [lang list][]. Documentation for
condition ID, icon, and main is at [weather conditions][].

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.

  ## OpenWeatherMap base URL
  # base_url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/"

  ## Timeout for HTTP response.
  # response_timeout = "5s"

  ## Preferred unit system for temperature and wind speed. Can be one of
  ## "metric", "imperial", or "standard".
  # units = "metric"

  ## Query interval; OpenWeatherMap weather data is updated every 10
  ## minutes.
  interval = "10m"
```
