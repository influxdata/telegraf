# Monitors internet speed using speedtest.net service
[[inputs.internet_speed]]
  ## This plugin downloads many MB of data each time it is run. As such
  ## consider setting a higher interval for this plugin to reduce the
  ## demand on your internet connection.
  # interval = "60m"

  ## Enable to reduce memory usage
  # memory_saving_mode = false

  ## Caches the closest server location
  # cache = false

  ## Number of concurrent connections
  ## By default or set to zero, the number of CPU cores is used. Use this to
  ## reduce the impact on system performance or to increase the connections on
  ## faster connections to ensure the fastest speed.
  # connections = 0

  ## Test mode
  ## By default, a single sever is used for testing. This may work for most,
  ## however, setting to "multi" will reach out to multiple servers in an
  ## attempt to get closer to ideal internet speeds.
  # test_mode = "single"

  ## Server ID exclude filter
  ## Allows the user to exclude or include specific server IDs received by
  ## speedtest-go. Values in the exclude option will be skipped over. Values in
  ## the include option are the only options that will be picked from.
  ##
  ## See the list of servers speedtest-go will return at:
  ##     https://www.speedtest.net/api/js/servers?engine=js&limit=10
