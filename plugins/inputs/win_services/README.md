    "TermService",
    "Win*",
  ]
```

### TICK Scripts

A sample TICK script for a notification about a not running service.
It sends a notification whenever any service changes its state to be not _running_ and when it changes that state back to _running_.
The notification is sent via an HTTP POST call.

```
stream
    |from()
        .database('telegraf')
        .retentionPolicy('autogen')
        .measurement('win_services')
        .groupBy('host','service_name')
    |alert()
        .crit(lambda: "state" != 4)
        .stateChangesOnly()
        .message('Service {{ index .Tags "service_name" }} on Host {{ index .Tags "host" }} is in state {{ index .Fields "state" }} ')
        .post('http://localhost:666/alert/service')
```
