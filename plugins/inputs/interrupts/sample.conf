# This plugin gathers interrupts data from /proc/interrupts and /proc/softirqs.
[[inputs.interrupts]]
  ## When set to true, cpu metrics are tagged with the cpu.  Otherwise cpu is
  ## stored as a field.
  ##
  ## The default is false for backwards compatibility, and will be changed to
  ## true in a future version.  It is recommended to set to true on new
  ## deployments.
  # cpu_as_tag = false

  ## To filter which IRQs to collect, make use of tagpass / tagdrop, i.e.
  # [inputs.interrupts.tagdrop]
  #   irq = [ "NET_RX", "TASKLET" ]
