# AMQP Consumer Input Plugin

This plugin provides a consumer for use with AMQP 0-9-1, a prominent
implementation of this protocol being [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

Metrics are read from a topic exchange using the configured queue and
binding_key.

Message payload should be formatted in one of the [Telegraf Data
Formats](../../../docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md).

For an introduction to AMQP see:

- [amqp - concepts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html)
- [rabbitmq: getting started](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html)

## Service Input <!-- @/docs/includes/service_input.md -->

This plugin is a service input. Normal plugins gather metrics determined by the
interval setting. Service plugins start a service to listens and waits for
metrics or events to occur. Service plugins have two key differences from
normal plugins:

1. The global or plugin specific `interval` setting may not apply
2. The CLI options of `--test`, `--test-wait`, and `--once` may not produce
   output for this plugin

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.

## Configuration

```toml @sample.conf
# AMQP consumer plugin
[[inputs.amqp_consumer]]
  ## Brokers to consume from.  If multiple brokers are specified a random broker
  ## will be selected anytime a connection is established.  This can be
  ## helpful for load balancing when not using a dedicated load balancer.
  brokers = ["amqp://localhost:5672/influxdb"]

  ## Authentication credentials for the PLAIN auth_method.
  # username = ""
  # password = ""

  ## Name of the exchange to declare.  If unset, no exchange will be declared.
  exchange = "telegraf"

  ## Exchange type; common types are "direct", "fanout", "topic", "header", "x-consistent-hash".
  # exchange_type = "topic"

  ## If true, exchange will be passively declared.
  # exchange_passive = false

  ## Exchange durability can be either "transient" or "durable".
  # exchange_durability = "durable"

  ## Additional exchange arguments.
  # exchange_arguments = { }
  # exchange_arguments = {"hash_property" = "timestamp"}

  ## AMQP queue name.
  queue = "telegraf"

  ## AMQP queue durability can be "transient" or "durable".
  queue_durability = "durable"

  ## If true, queue will be passively declared.
  # queue_passive = false

  ## Additional arguments when consuming from Queue
  # queue_consume_arguments = { }
  # queue_consume_arguments = {"x-stream-offset" = "first"}

  ## A binding between the exchange and queue using this binding key is
  ## created.  If unset, no binding is created.
  binding_key = "#"

  ## Maximum number of messages server should give to the worker.
  # prefetch_count = 50

  ## Max undelivered messages
  ## This plugin uses tracking metrics, which ensure messages are read to
  ## outputs before acknowledging them to the original broker to ensure data
  ## is not lost. This option sets the maximum messages to read from the
  ## broker that have not been written by an output.
  ##
  ## This value needs to be picked with awareness of the agent's
  ## metric_batch_size value as well. Setting max undelivered messages too high
  ## can result in a constant stream of data batches to the output. While
  ## setting it too low may never flush the broker's messages.
  # max_undelivered_messages = 1000

  ## Auth method. PLAIN and EXTERNAL are supported
  ## Using EXTERNAL requires enabling the rabbitmq_auth_mechanism_ssl plugin as
  ## described here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html
  # auth_method = "PLAIN"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ## Content encoding for message payloads, can be set to
  ## "gzip", "identity" or "auto"
  ## - Use "gzip" to decode gzip
  ## - Use "identity" to apply no encoding
  ## - Use "auto" determine the encoding using the ContentEncoding header
  # content_encoding = "identity"

  ## Maximum size of decoded message.
  ## Acceptable units are B, KiB, KB, MiB, MB...
  ## Without quotes and units, interpreted as size in bytes.
  # max_decompression_size = "500MB"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"
```
