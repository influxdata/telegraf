  ## Compression codec represents the various compression codecs recognized by

  ## Maximum number of retries for metadata operations including
  ## connecting. Sets Sarama library's Metadata.Retry.Max config value. If 0 or
  ## unset, use the Sarama default of 3,
  # metadata_retry_max = 0

  ## Type of retry backoff. Valid options: "constant", "exponential"
  # metadata_retry_type = "constant"

  ## Amount of time to wait before retrying. When metadata_retry_type is
  ## "constant", each retry is delayed this amount. When "exponential", the
  ## first retry is delayed this amount, and subsequent delays are doubled. If 0
  ## or unset, use the Sarama default of 250 ms
  # metadata_retry_backoff = 0

  ## Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying when metadata_retry_type is
  ## "exponential". Ignored for other retry types. If 0, there is no backoff
  ## limit.
  # metadata_retry_max_duration = 0

  ## Strategy for making connection to kafka brokers. Valid options: "startup",
  ## "defer". If set to "defer" the plugin is allowed to start before making a
  ## connection. This is useful if the broker may be down when telegraf is
  ## started, but if there are any typos in the broker setting, they will cause
  ## connection failures without warning at startup
  # connection_strategy = "startup"

  ## Maximum length of a message to consume, in bytes (default 0/unlimited);
  ## larger messages are dropped
  max_message_len = 1000000

  ## Max undelivered messages
  ## This plugin uses tracking metrics, which ensure messages are read to
  ## outputs before acknowledging them to the original broker to ensure data
  ## is not lost. This option sets the maximum messages to read from the
  ## broker that have not been written by an output.
  ##
  ## This value needs to be picked with awareness of the agent's
  ## metric_batch_size value as well. Setting max undelivered messages too high
  ## can result in a constant stream of data batches to the output. While
  ## setting it too low may never flush the broker's messages.
  # max_undelivered_messages = 1000

  ## Maximum amount of time the consumer should take to process messages. If
  ## the debug log prints messages from sarama about 'abandoning subscription
  ## to [topic] because consuming was taking too long', increase this value to
  ## longer than the time taken by the output plugin(s).
  ##
  ## Note that the effective timeout could be between 'max_processing_time' and
  ## '2 * max_processing_time'.
  # max_processing_time = "100ms"

  ## The default number of message bytes to fetch from the broker in each
  ## request (default 1MB). This should be larger than the majority of
  ## your messages, or else the consumer will spend a lot of time
  ## negotiating sizes and not actually consuming. Similar to the JVM's
  ## `fetch.message.max.bytes`.
  # consumer_fetch_default = "1MB"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"
