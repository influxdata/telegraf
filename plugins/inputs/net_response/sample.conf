# Collect response time of a TCP or UDP connection
[[inputs.net_response]]
  ## Protocol, must be "tcp" or "udp"
  ## NOTE: because the "udp" protocol does not respond to requests, it requires
  ## a send/expect string pair (see below).
  protocol = "tcp"
  ## Server address (default localhost)
  address = "localhost:80"

  ## Set timeout
  # timeout = "1s"

  ## Set read timeout (only used if expecting a response)
  # read_timeout = "1s"

  ## The following options are required for UDP checks. For TCP, they are
  ## optional. The plugin will send the given string to the server and then
  ## expect to receive the given 'expect' string back.
  ## string sent to the server
  # send = "ssh"
  ## expected string in answer
  # expect = "ssh"

  ## Uncomment to remove deprecated fields; recommended for new deploys
  # fielddrop = ["result_type", "string_found"]
