# Webhooks Input Plugin

This is a Telegraf service plugin that start an http server and register multiple webhook listeners.

```sh
telegraf config -input-filter webhooks -output-filter influxdb > config.conf.new
```

Change the config file to point to the InfluxDB server you are using and adjust the settings to match your environment. Once that is complete:

```sh
cp config.conf.new /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
sudo service telegraf start
```

## Configuration

## Adding new webhooks plugin

1. Add your webhook plugin inside the `webhooks` folder
1. Your plugin must implement the `Webhook` interface
1. Import your plugin in the `webhooks.go` file and add it to the `Webhooks` struct

Both [Github](github/) and [Rollbar](rollbar/) are good example to follow.
