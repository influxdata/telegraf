# Configuration for the AWS Kinesis input.
[[inputs.kinesis_consumer]]
  ## Amazon REGION of kinesis endpoint.
  region = "ap-southeast-2"

  ## Amazon Credentials
  ## Credentials are loaded in the following order
  ## 1) Web identity provider credentials via STS if role_arn and web_identity_token_file are specified
  ## 2) Assumed credentials via STS if role_arn is specified
  ## 3) explicit credentials from 'access_key' and 'secret_key'
  ## 4) shared profile from 'profile'
  ## 5) environment variables
  ## 6) shared credentials file
  ## 7) EC2 Instance Profile
  # access_key = ""
  # secret_key = ""
  # token = ""
  # role_arn = ""
  # web_identity_token_file = ""
  # role_session_name = ""
  # profile = ""
  # shared_credential_file = ""

  ## Endpoint to make request against, the correct endpoint is automatically
  ## determined and this option should only be set if you wish to override the
  ## default.
  ##   ex: endpoint_url = "http://localhost:8000"
  # endpoint_url = ""

  ## Kinesis StreamName must exist prior to starting telegraf.
  streamname = "StreamName"

  ## Shard iterator type (only 'TRIM_HORIZON' and 'LATEST' currently supported)
  # shard_iterator_type = "TRIM_HORIZON"

  ## Max undelivered messages
  ## This plugin uses tracking metrics, which ensure messages are read to
  ## outputs before acknowledging them to the original broker to ensure data
  ## is not lost. This option sets the maximum messages to read from the
  ## broker that have not been written by an output.
  ##
  ## This value needs to be picked with awareness of the agent's
  ## metric_batch_size value as well. Setting max undelivered messages too high
  ## can result in a constant stream of data batches to the output. While
  ## setting it too low may never flush the broker's messages.
  # max_undelivered_messages = 1000

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  data_format = "influx"

  ##
  ## The content encoding of the data from kinesis
  ## If you are processing a cloudwatch logs kinesis stream then set this to "gzip"
  ## as AWS compresses cloudwatch log data before it is sent to kinesis (aws
  ## also base64 encodes the zip byte data before pushing to the stream.  The base64 decoding
  ## is done automatically by the golang sdk, as data is read from kinesis)
  ##
  # content_encoding = "identity"

  ## Optional
  ## Configuration for a dynamodb checkpoint
  [inputs.kinesis_consumer.checkpoint_dynamodb]
    ## unique name for this consumer
    app_name = "default"
    table_name = "default"
