# Monitor UPSes connected via Network UPS Tools
[[inputs.upsd]]
  ## A running NUT server to connect to.
  ## IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets (e.g. "[::1]")
  # server = "127.0.0.1"
  # port = 3493
  # username = "user"
  # password = "password"

  ## Force parsing numbers as floats
  ## It is highly recommended to enable this setting to parse numbers
  ## consistently as floats to avoid database conflicts where some numbers are
  ## parsed as integers and others as floats.
  # force_float = false

  ## Collect additional fields if they are available for the UPS
  ## The fields need to be specified as NUT variable names, see
  ## https://networkupstools.org/docs/developer-guide.chunked/apas02.html
  ## Wildcards are accepted.
  # additional_fields = []

  ## Dump information for debugging
  ## Allows to print the raw variables (and corresponding types) as received
  ## from the NUT server ONCE for each UPS. The output is only available when
  ## running Telegraf in debug-mode.
  ## Please attach this information when reporting issues!
  # dump_raw_variables = false
