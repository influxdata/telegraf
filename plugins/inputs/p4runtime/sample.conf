  ## Define the endpoint of P4Runtime gRPC server to collect metrics.
  # endpoint = "127.0.0.1:9559"
  ## Set DeviceID required for Client Arbitration.
  ## https://p4.org/p4-spec/p4runtime/main/P4Runtime-Spec.html#sec-client-arbitration-and-controller-replication
  # device_id = 1
  ## Filter counters by their names that should be observed.
  ## Example: counter_names_include=["ingressCounter", "egressCounter"]
  # counter_names_include = []

  ## Optional TLS Config.
  ## Enable client-side TLS and define CA to authenticate the device.
  # enable_tls = false
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.crt"
  ## Set minimal TLS version to accept by the client.
  # tls_min_version = "TLS12"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification.
  # insecure_skip_verify = true

  ## Define client-side TLS certificate & key to authenticate to the device.
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/client.crt"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/client.key"
