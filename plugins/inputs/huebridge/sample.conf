# Gather Hue smart home status
[[inputs.huebridge]]
  ## The Hue bridges to query. Usually identified via URLs of the form:
  ##   "address://<bridge id>:<user name>@<bridge hostname or IP address>/"
  ## See README file for a full description of all addressing options
  ## and how to create the necessary user name.
  bridges = [ "address://0123456789ABCDEF:sFlEGnMAFXO6RtZV17aViNUB95G2uXWw64texDzD@192.168.1.123/" ]
  
  ## Manual device to room assignments to apply during status evaluation.
  ## In case a device cannot be assigned to a room (e.g. a motion sensor),
  ## this table supports manual assignment.
  # room_assignments = { "Motion sensor 1" = "Living room", "Motion sensor 2" = "Corridor" }
  
  ## Timeout for gathering information
  # timeout = "10s"
  
  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  # tls_key_pwd = "secret"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
