# Gather smart home status from Hue Bridge
[[inputs.huebridge]]
  ## URL of bridges to query in the form <scheme>://<bridge id>:<user name>@<address>/
  ## See documentation for available schemes.
  bridges = [ "address://<bridge id>:<user name>@<bridge hostname or address>/" ]
  
  ## Manual device to room assignments to apply during status evaluation.
  ## E.g. for motion sensors which are reported without a room assignment.
  # room_assignments = { "Motion sensor 1" = "Living room", "Motion sensor 2" = "Corridor" }
  
  ## Timeout for gathering information
  # timeout = "10s"
  
  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  # tls_key_pwd = "secret"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
