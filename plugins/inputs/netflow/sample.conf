[[inputs.netflow]]
  ## Address to listen for netflow/ipfix packets.
  ##   example: service_address = "udp://:2055"
  ##            service_address = "udp4://:2055"
  ##            service_address = "udp6://:2055"
  service_address = "udp://:2055"

  ## Set the size of the operating system's receive buffer.
  ##   example: read_buffer_size = "64KiB"
  # read_buffer_size = ""

  ## Dump incoming packets to the log
  ## This can be helpful to debug parsing issues. Only active if
  ## Telegraf is in debug mode.
  # dump_packets = false
