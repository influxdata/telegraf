  ## Enable workarounds required by some devices to work correctly
  # [inputs.modbus.workarounds]
    ## Pause after connect delays the first request by the specified time.
    ## This might be necessary for (slow) devices.
    # pause_after_connect = "0ms"

    ## Pause between read requests sent to the device.
    ## This might be necessary for (slow) serial devices.
    # pause_between_requests = "0ms"

    ## Close the connection after every gather cycle.
    ## Usually the plugin closes the connection after a certain idle-timeout,
    ## however, if you query a device with limited simultaneous connectivity
    ## (e.g. serial devices) from multiple instances you might want to only
    ## stay connected during gather and disconnect afterwards.
    # close_connection_after_gather = false

    ## Force the plugin to read each field in a separate request.
    ## This might be necessary for devices not conforming to the spec,
    ## see https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/issues/12071.
    # one_request_per_field = false
