  ## Enable workarounds required by some devices to work correctly
  # [inputs.modbus.workarounds]
    ## Pause after connect delays the first request by the specified time. This might be necessary for (slow) devices.
    # pause_after_connect = "0ms"
    ## Pause between read requests sent to the device. This might be necessary for (slow) serial devices.
    # pause_between_requests = "0ms"
    ## Close the connection after every gather cycle. Usually the plugin closes the connection after a certain
    ## idle-timeout, however, if you query a device with limited simultaneous connectivity (e.g. serial devices)
    ## from multiple instances you might want to only stay connected during gather and disconnect afterwards.
    # close_connection_after_gather = false
