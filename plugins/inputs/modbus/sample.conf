# Retrieve data from MODBUS slave devices
[[inputs.modbus]]
  ## Connection Configuration
  ##
  ## The plugin supports connections to PLCs via MODBUS/TCP, RTU over TCP, ASCII over TCP or
  ## via serial line communication in binary (RTU) or readable (ASCII) encoding
  ##
  ## Device name (in case of a "register" configuration style). For a "request" configuration style this 
  ## name may refer to your modbus controller as the request style configuration supports multiple slave devices
  name = "Device"

  ## In case the name tag or other modbus related tags are not needed in the output, exclude them 
  ## with e.g. tagexclude = ["name","slave_id","type"]
  
  ## Slave ID - addresses a MODBUS device on the bus (in case of a "register" configuration style)
  ## Range: 0 - 255 [0 = broadcast; 248 - 255 = reserved]
  slave_id = 1

  ## Timeout for each request
  timeout = "1s"

  ## Maximum number of retries and the time to wait between retries
  ## when a slave-device is busy.
  # busy_retries = 0
  # busy_retries_wait = "100ms"

  # TCP - connect via Modbus/TCP
  controller = "tcp://localhost:502"

  ## Serial (RS485; RS232)
  # controller = "file:///dev/ttyUSB0"
  # baud_rate = 9600
  # data_bits = 8
  # parity = "N"
  # stop_bits = 1

  ## For Modbus over TCP you can choose between "TCP", "RTUoverTCP" and "ASCIIoverTCP"
  ## default behaviour is "TCP" if the controller is TCP
  ## For Serial you can choose between "RTU" and "ASCII"
  # transmission_mode = "RTU"

  ## Trace the connection to the modbus device as debug messages
  ## Note: You have to enable telegraf's debug mode to see those messages!
  # debug_connection = false

  ## Define the configuration schema
  ##  |---register -- define fields per register type in the original style (only supports one slave ID)
  ##  |---request  -- define fields on a requests base
  configuration_type = "register"

  ## --- "request" configuration style ---

  ## Per request definition
  ##

  ## Define a request sent to the device
  ## Multiple of those requests can be defined. Data will be collated into metrics at the end of data collection.
  [[inputs.modbus.request]]
    ## ID of the modbus slave device to query.
    ## If you need to query multiple slave-devices, create several "request" definitions.
    slave_id = 1

    ## Byte order of the data.
    ##  |---ABCD -- Big Endian (Motorola)
    ##  |---DCBA -- Little Endian (Intel)
    ##  |---BADC -- Big Endian with byte swap
    ##  |---CDAB -- Little Endian with byte swap
    byte_order = "ABCD"

    ## Type of the register for the request
    ## Can be "coil", "discrete", "holding" or "input"
    register = "coil"

    ## Name of the measurement.
    ## Can be overriden by the individual field definitions. Defaults to "modbus"
    # measurement = "modbus"

    ## Field definitions
    ## Analog Variables, Input Registers and Holding Registers
    ## address        - address of the register to query. For coil and discrete inputs this is the bit address.
    ## name *1        - field name
    ## type *1,2      - type of the modbus field, can be INT16, UINT16, INT32, UINT32, INT64, UINT64 and
    ##                  FLOAT32, FLOAT64 (IEEE 754 binary representation)
    ## scale *1,2     - (optional) factor to scale the variable with
    ## output *1,2    - (optional) type of resulting field, can be INT64, UINT64 or FLOAT64. Defaults to FLOAT64 if
    ##                  "scale" is provided and to the input "type" class otherwise (i.e. INT* -> INT64, etc).
    ## measurement *1 - (optional) measurement name, defaults to the setting of the request
    ## omit           - (optional) omit this field. Useful to leave out single values when querying many registers
    ##                  with a single request. Defaults to "false".
    ##
    ## *1: Those fields are ignored if field is omitted ("omit"=true)
    ##
    ## *2: Thise fields are ignored for both "coil" and "discrete"-input type of registers. For those register types
    ##     the fields are output as zero or one in UINT64 format by default.
