Measurement names:

- cache_bypass_misses
- cache_hit_ratio
- cache_hits
- cache_miss_collisions
- cache_misses
- cache_readaheads

### Description

```
dirty_data
  Amount of dirty data for this backing device in the cache. Continuously
  updated unlike the cache set's version, but may be slightly off.

bypassed
  Amount of IO (both reads and writes) that has bypassed the cache


cache_bypass_hits
cache_bypass_misses
  Hits and misses for IO that is intended to skip the cache are still counted,
  but broken out here.

cache_hits
cache_misses
cache_hit_ratio
  Hits and misses are counted per individual IO as bcache sees them; a
  partial hit is counted as a miss.

cache_miss_collisions
  Counts instances where data was going to be inserted into the cache from a
  cache miss, but raced with a write and data was already present (usually 0
  since the synchronization for cache misses was rewritten)

cache_readaheads
  Count of times readahead occurred.
```

# Example output

Using this configuration:

```
[bcache]
  # Bcache sets path
  # If not specified, then default is:
  # bcachePath = "/sys/fs/bcache"
  #
  # By default, telegraf gather stats for all bcache devices
  # Setting devices will restrict the stats to the specified
  # bcache devices.
  # bcacheDevs = ["bcache0", ...]
```

When run with:

```
./telegraf -config telegraf.conf -input-filter bcache -test
```

It produces:
