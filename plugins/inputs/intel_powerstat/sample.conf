# Intel PowerStat plugin enables monitoring of platform metrics (power, TDP)
# and per-CPU metrics like temperature, power and utilization. Please see the
# plugin readme for details on software and hardware compatibility.
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux.
[[inputs.intel_powerstat]]
  ## The user can choose which package metrics are monitored by the plugin with
  ## the package_metrics setting:
  ## - The default, will collect "current_power_consumption",
  ##   "current_dram_power_consumption" and "thermal_design_power".
  ## - Leaving this setting empty means no package metrics will be collected.
  ## - Finally, a user can specify individual metrics to capture from the
  ##   supported options list.
  ## Supported options:
  ##   "current_power_consumption", "current_dram_power_consumption",
  ##   "thermal_design_power", "max_turbo_frequency", "uncore_frequency",
  ##   "cpu_base_frequency"
  # package_metrics = ["current_power_consumption", "current_dram_power_consumption", "thermal_design_power"]

  ## The user can choose which per-CPU metrics are monitored by the plugin in
  ## cpu_metrics array.
  ## Empty or missing array means no per-CPU specific metrics will be collected
  ## by the plugin.
  ## Supported options:
  ##   "cpu_frequency", "cpu_c0_state_residency", "cpu_c1_state_residency",
  ##   "cpu_c3_state_residency", "cpu_c6_state_residency", "cpu_c7_state_residency",
  ##   "cpu_temperature", "cpu_busy_frequency", "cpu_c0_substate_c01",
  ##   "cpu_c0_substate_c02", "cpu_c0_substate_c0_wait"
  # cpu_metrics = []

  ## Optionally the user can choose for which CPUs metrics configured in cpu_metrics array should be gathered.
  ## Can't be combined with excluded_cpus.
  ## Empty or missing array means CPU metrics are gathered for all CPUs.
  ## e.g. ["0-3", "4,5,6"] or ["1-3,4"]
  # included_cpus = []

  ## Optionally the user can choose which CPUs should be excluded from gathering metrics configured in cpu_metrics array.
  ## Can't be combined with included_cpus.
  ## Empty or missing array means CPU metrics are gathered for all CPUs.
  ## e.g. ["0-3", "4,5,6"] or ["1-3,4"]
  # excluded_cpus = []

  ## Filesystem location of JSON file that contains PMU event definitions.
  ## Mandatory only for perf-related metrics (cpu_c0_substate_c01, cpu_c0_substate_c02, cpu_c0_substate_c0_wait).
  # event_definitions = ""

  ## The user can set the timeout duration for MSR reading.
  ## Enabling this timeout can be useful in situations where, on heavily loaded systems,
  ## the code waits too long for a kernel response to MSR read requests.
  ## 0 disables the timeout (default).
  # msr_read_timeout = "0ms"
