# Intel PowerStat plugin enables monitoring of platform metrics (power, TDP)
# and per-CPU metrics like temperature, power and utilization. Please see the
# plugin readme for details on software and hardware compatability.
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux
[[inputs.intel_powerstat]]
  ## The user can choose which package metrics are monitored by the plugin with
  ## the package_metrics setting:
  ## - The default, will collect "current_power_consumption",
  ##   "current_dram_power_consumption" and "thermal_design_power"
  ## - Leaving this setting empty means no package metrics will be collected
  ## - Finally, a user can specify individual metrics to capture from the
  ##   supported options list
  ## Supported options:
  ##   "current_power_consumption", "current_dram_power_consumption",
  ##   "thermal_design_power", "max_turbo_frequency", "uncore_frequency",
  ##   "cpu_base_frequency"
  # package_metrics = ["current_power_consumption", "current_dram_power_consumption", "thermal_design_power"]

  ## The user can choose which per-CPU metrics are monitored by the plugin in
  ## cpu_metrics array.
  ## Empty or missing array means no per-CPU specific metrics will be collected
  ## by the plugin.
  ## Supported options:
  ##   "cpu_frequency", "cpu_c0_state_residency", "cpu_c1_state_residency",
  ##   "cpu_c6_state_residency", "cpu_busy_cycles", "cpu_temperature",
  ##   "cpu_busy_frequency"
  ## ATTENTION: cpu_busy_cycles is DEPRECATED - use cpu_c0_state_residency
  # cpu_metrics = []

  ## In the case of increased load where the plugin hangs, the user can
  ## set a timeout duration for MSR reading. A timeout of 100ms is recommended.
  ## The default behavior is to not have a timeout.
  # msr_read_timeout = "0"
