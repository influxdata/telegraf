# The Socket Service Input

## A note on UDP/IP OS Buffer sizes

If you're using UDP input and running Linux or FreeBSD, please adjust your UDP buffer
size limit, [see here for more details.](../udp/README.md#a-note-on-udpip-os-buffer-sizes)

## Configuration

Each Socket input allows the binding address, and protocol to be set. 
Currently socket service input only support two line protocol formats of metric: influx and graphite.
Each input allows to use data_format to choose which format of contents will be sent to this socket service.

## Parsing Metrics

The Socket service input plugin allows measurements to be saved using the influx or graphite line protocol. By default, enabling the socket plugin will allow you to collect influx or graphite metrics and store them using the metric name as the measurement.  If you send a graphite metric named `servers.localhost.cpu.loadavg.10`, it will store the full metric name as the measurement with no extracted tags.

While this default setup works, it is not the ideal way to store measurements in InfluxDB since it does not take advantage of tags.  It also will not perform optimally with a large dataset sizes since queries will be forced to use regexes which is known to not scale well.

To extract tags from metrics, one or more templates must be configured to parse metrics into tags and measurements.

## Templates

Templates allow matching parts of a metric name to be used as tag keys in the stored metric.  They have a similar format to graphite metric names.  The values in between the separators are used as the tag keys.  The location of the tag key that matches the same position as the graphite metric section is used as the value.  If there is no value, the graphite portion is skipped.

The special value _measurement_ is used to define the measurement name.  It can have a trailing `*` to indicate that the remainder of the metric should be used.  If a _measurement_ is not specified, the full metric name is used.

### Basic Matching

`servers.localhost.cpu.loadavg.10`
* Template: `.host.resource.measurement*`
* Output:  _measurement_ =`loadavg.10` _tags_ =`host=localhost resource=cpu`

### Multiple Measurement Matching

The _measurement_ can be specified multiple times in a template to provide more control over the measurement name.  Multiple values
will be joined together using the _Separator_ config variable.  By default, this value is `.`.

`servers.localhost.cpu.cpu0.user`
* Template: `.host.measurement.cpu.measurement`
* Output: _measurement_ = `cpu.user` _tags_ = `host=localhost cpu=cpu0`

Since '.' requires queries on measurements to be double-quoted, you may want to set this to `_` to simplify querying parsed metrics.

`servers.localhost.cpu.cpu0.user`
* Separator: `_`
* Template: `.host.measurement.cpu.measurement`
* Output: _measurement_ = `cpu_user` _tags_ = `host=localhost cpu=cpu0`

### Adding Tags

Additional tags can be added to a metric that don't exist on the received metric.  You can add additional tags by specifying them after the pattern.  Tags have the same format as the line protocol.  Multiple tags are separated by commas.

`servers.localhost.cpu.loadavg.10`
* Template: `.host.resource.measurement* region=us-west,zone=1a`
* Output:  _measurement_ = `loadavg.10` _tags_ = `host=localhost resource=cpu region=us-west zone=1a`

### Fields

A field key can be specified by using the keyword _field_. By default if no _field_ keyword is specified then the metric will be written to a field named _value_.

When using the current default engine _BZ1_, it's recommended to use a single field per value for performance reasons.

When using the _TSM1_ engine it's possible to amend measurement metrics with additional fields, e.g:

Input:
```
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.rx_packets 461295119435 1444234982
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.tx_bytes 1093086493388480 1444234982
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.rx_bytes 1015633926034834 1444234982
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.tx_errors 0 1444234982
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.rx_errors 0 1444234982
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.tx_dropped 0 1444234982
sensu.metric.net.server0.eth0.rx_dropped 0 1444234982
```

With template:
```
sensu.metric.* ..measurement.host.interface.field
```

Becomes database entry:
```
> select * from net
name: net
---------
time      host  interface rx_bytes    rx_dropped  rx_errors rx_packets    tx_bytes    tx_dropped  tx_errors
1444234982000000000 server0  eth0    1.015633926034834e+15 0   0   4.61295119435e+11 1.09308649338848e+15  0 0
```

## Multiple Templates

One template may not match all metrics.  For example, using multiple plugins with diamond will produce metrics in different formats.  If you need to use multiple templates, you'll need to define a prefix filter that must match before the template can be applied.

### Filters

Filters have a similar format to templates but work more like wildcard expressions.  When multiple filters would match a metric, the more specific one is chosen.  Filters are configured by adding them before the template.

For example,

```
servers.localhost.cpu.loadavg.10
servers.host123.elasticsearch.cache_hits 100
servers.host456.mysql.tx_count 10
servers.host789.prod.mysql.tx_count 10
```
* `servers.*` would match all values
* `servers.*.mysql` would match `servers.host456.mysql.tx_count 10`
* `servers.localhost.*` would match `servers.localhost.cpu.loadavg`
* `servers.*.*.mysql` would match `servers.host789.prod.mysql.tx_count 10`

## Default Templates

If no template filters are defined or you want to just have one basic template, you can define a default template.  This template will apply to any metric that has not already matched a filter.

```
dev.http.requests.200
prod.myapp.errors.count
dev.db.queries.count
```

* `env.app.measurement*` would create
  * _measurement_=`requests.200` _tags_=`env=dev,app=http`
  * _measurement_= `errors.count` _tags_=`env=prod,app=myapp`
  * _measurement_=`queries.count` _tags_=`env=dev,app=db`

## Global Tags

If you need to add the same set of tags to all metrics, you can define them globally at the plugin level and not within each template description.

## Minimal Config
```
[[inputs.socket]]
  bind_address = ":3003" # the bind address
  protocol = "tcp" # or "udp" protocol to read via
  udp_read_buffer = 8388608 # (8*1024*1024) UDP read buffer size

  # Data format to consume. This can be "influx" or "graphite" (line-protocol)
  # NOTE json only reads numerical measurements, strings and booleans are ignored.
  data_format = "graphite"

  ### If matching multiple measurement files, this string will be used to join the matched values.
  separator = "."

  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
  ### tags following the template.  Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ### similar to the line protocol format.  The can be only one default template.
  ### Templates support below format:
  ### 1. filter + template
  ### 2. filter + template + extra tag
  ### 3. filter + template with field key
  ### 4. default template
  templates = [
    "*.app env.service.resource.measurement",
    "stats.* .host.measurement* region=us-west,agent=sensu",
    "stats2.* .host.measurement.field",
    "measurement*"
 ]
```
