  ## Path to listen to.

  ## Maximum duration before timing out read of the request
  # read_timeout = "10s"
  ## Maximum duration before timing out write of the response. This should be
  ## set to a value large enough that you can send at least 'metric_batch_size'
  ## number of messages within the duration.
  # write_timeout = "10s"

  ## Maximum allowed http request body size in bytes.
  ## 0 means to use the default of 524,288,00 bytes (500 mebibytes)
  # max_body_size = "500MB"

  ## Whether to add the pubsub metadata, such as message attributes and
  ## subscription as a tag.
  # add_meta = false

  ## Optional. Maximum messages to read from PubSub that have not been written
  ## to an output. Defaults to 1000.
  ## For best throughput set based on the number of metrics within
  ## each message and the size of the output's metric_batch_size.
  ##
  ## For example, if each message contains 10 metrics and the output
  ## metric_batch_size is 1000, setting this to 100 will ensure that a
  ## full batch is collected and the write is triggered immediately without
  ## waiting until the next flush_interval.
  # max_undelivered_messages = 1000

  ## Set one or more allowed client CA certificate file names to
  ## enable mutually authenticated TLS connections
  # tls_allowed_cacerts = ["/etc/telegraf/clientca.pem"]

  ## Add service certificate and key
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
