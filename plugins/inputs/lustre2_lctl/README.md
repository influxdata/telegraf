# Lustre Input Plugin 
The [Lustre][]Â® file system is an open-source, parallel file system that
supports many requirements of leadership class HPC simulation environments.

This plugin monitors the Lustre file system using its utility `lctl get_param`.

Note that this plugins has been only tested on Lustre@v2.12.7 and Luster@v2.15.0.

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.

[CONFIGURATION.md]: ../../../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#plugins

## Configuration
```toml @sample.conf
# Read metrics about Lustre components, including ost/oss, mdt/mds, client.
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux.
[[inputs.lustre2_lctl]]
  ## According to different components, you could choose to gather pointed data about the component.

  ## OST/OSS 
  #  Switch to gather recovery status of ost and capacity of ost.
  [inputs.lustre2_lctl.ost.obdfilter]
    recovery_status = true
    capacity = true
  # Switch to gather job stats of ost.
  # rw is information about read or write.
  # operation is io operation except read and write, such as create, destory etc.
  [inputs.lustre2_lctl.ost.obdfilter.job_stats]
    rw = true
    operation = true

  # Switch to gather stats of ost.
  # rw is information about read or write.
  # operation is io operation except read and write, such as create, destory etc.
  [inputs.lustre2_lctl.ost.obdfilter.stats]
    rw = true
    operation = true
  
  ## MDT/MDS
  [inputs.lustre2_lctl.mdt]
    recovery_status = true

  
  [inputs.lustre2_lctl.mdt.stats]
    rw = true
    operation = true

  [inputs.lustre2_lctl.mdt.job_stats]
    rw = true
    operation = true
    
  ## Client
  client = true
```
