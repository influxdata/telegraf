# SQL Server Input Plugin
The `sqlserver` plugin provides metrics for your SQL Server instance. Recorded metrics are
lightweight and use Dynamic Management Views supplied by SQL Server.

### The SQL Server plugin supports the following editions/versions of SQL Server
- SQL Server
  - 2012 or newer (Plugin support aligned with the [official Microsoft SQL Server support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/end-of-support/sql-server-end-of-life-overview?view=sql-server-ver15#lifecycle-dates))
  - End-of-life SQL Server versions are not guaranteed to be supported by Telegraf. Any issues with the SQL Server plugin for these EOL versions will 
  need to be addressed by the community. 
- Azure SQL Database (Single)
- Azure SQL Managed Instance

### Additional Setup:

You have to create a login on every SQL Server instance  or Azure SQL Managed instance you want to monitor, with following script:
```sql
USE master;
GO
CREATE LOGIN [telegraf] WITH PASSWORD = N'mystrongpassword';
GO
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [telegraf];
GO
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [telegraf];
GO
```

For Azure SQL Database, you require the View Database State permission and can create a user with a password directly in the database.
```sql
CREATE USER [telegraf] WITH PASSWORD = N'mystrongpassword';
GO
GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [telegraf];
GO
```

### Configuration:

```toml
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs, can be changed as per collection interval needs
  interval = "10s"

# Read metrics from Microsoft SQL Server
[[inputs.sqlserver]]
  ## Specify instances to monitor with a list of connection strings.
  ## All connection parameters are optional.
  ## By default, the host is localhost, listening on default port, TCP 1433.
  ##   for Windows, the user is the currently running AD user (SSO).
  ##   See https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb for detailed connection
  ##   parameters, in particular, tls connections can be created like so:
  ##   "encrypt=true;certificate=<cert>;hostNameInCertificate=<SqlServer host fqdn>"
  servers = [
    "Server=192.168.1.10;Port=1433;User Id=<user>;Password=<pw>;app name=telegraf;log=1;",
  ]

  ## "database_type" enables a specific set of queries depending on the database type. If specified, it replaces azuredb = true/false and query_version = 2
  ## In the config file, the sql server plugin section should be repeated each with a set of servers for a specific database_type.
  ## Possible values for database_type are - "AzureSQLDB" or "AzureSQLManagedInstance" or "SQLServer"

  ## Queries enabled by default for database_type = "AzureSQLDB" are - 
  ## AzureSQLDBResourceStats, AzureSQLDBResourceGovernance, AzureSQLDBWaitStats, AzureSQLDBDatabaseIO, AzureSQLDBServerProperties, 
  ## AzureSQLDBOsWaitstats, AzureSQLDBMemoryClerks, AzureSQLDBPerformanceCounters, AzureSQLDBRequests, AzureSQLDBSchedulers

  # database_type = "AzureSQLDB"

  ## A list of queries to include. If not specified, all the above listed queries are used.
  # include_query = []

  ## A list of queries to explicitly ignore.
  # exclude_query = []

  ## Queries enabled by default for database_type = "AzureSQLManagedInstance" are - 
  ## AzureSQLMIResourceStats, AzureSQLMIResourceGovernance, AzureSQLMIDatabaseIO, AzureSQLMIServerProperties, AzureSQLMIOsWaitstats, 
  ## AzureSQLMIMemoryClerks, AzureSQLMIPerformanceCounters, AzureSQLMIRequests, AzureSQLMISchedulers

  # database_type = "AzureSQLManagedInstance"

  # include_query = []

  # exclude_query = []

  ## Queries enabled by default for database_type = "SQLServer" are - 
  ## SQLServerPerformanceCounters, SQLServerWaitStatsCategorized, SQLServerDatabaseIO, SQLServerProperties, SQLServerMemoryClerks, 
  ## SQLServerSchedulers, SQLServerRequests, SQLServerVolumeSpace, SQLServerCpu

  database_type = "SQLServer"

  include_query = []

  ## SQLServerAvailabilityReplicaStates and SQLServerDatabaseReplicaStates are optional queries and hence excluded here as default
  exclude_query = ["SQLServerAvailabilityReplicaStates", "SQLServerDatabaseReplicaStates"]

  ## Following are old config settings, you may use them only if you are using the earlier flavor of queries, however it is recommended to use 
  ## the new mechanism of identifying the database_type there by use it's corresponding queries

  ## Optional parameter, setting this to 2 will use a new version
  ## of the collection queries that break compatibility with the original
  ## dashboards.
  ## Version 2 - is compatible from SQL Server 2012 and later versions and also for SQL Azure DB
  # query_version = 2

  ## If you are using AzureDB, setting this to true will gather resource utilization metrics
  # azuredb = false

  ## Toggling this to true will emit an additional metric called "sqlserver_telegraf_health". 
  ## This metric tracks the count of attempted queries and successful queries for each SQL instance specified in "servers". 
  ## The purpose of this metric is to assist with identifying and diagnosing any connectivity or query issues. 
  ## This setting/metric is optional and is disabled by default.
  # health_metric = false

  ## Possible queries accross different versions of the collectors

### Support for Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication using [Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)

Azure SQL Database supports 2 main methods of authentication: [SQL authentication and AAD authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview#authentication). The recommended practice is to [use AAD authentication when possible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview).

AAD is a more modern authentication protocol, allows for easier credential/role management, and can eliminate the need to include passwords in a connection string.

To enable support for AAD authentication, we leverage the existing AAD authentication support in the [SQL Server driver for Go](https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb#azure-active-directory-authentication---preview)

#### How to use AAD Auth with MSI

- Configure "system-assigned managed identity" for Azure resources on the Monitoring VM (the VM that'd connect to the SQL server/database) [using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm).
- On the database being monitored, create/update a USER with the name of the Monitoring VM as the principal using the below script. This might require allow-listing the client machine's IP address (from where the below SQL script is being run) on the SQL Server resource.
```sql
EXECUTE ('IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.database_principals WHERE name = ''<Monitoring_VM_Name>'')
    BEGIN
        DROP USER [<Monitoring_VM_Name>]
    END')
EXECUTE ('CREATE USER [<Monitoring_VM_Name>] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER')
EXECUTE ('GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [<Monitoring_VM_Name>]')
```
- On the SQL Server resource of the database(s) being monitored, go to "Firewalls and Virtual Networks" tab and allowlist the monitoring VM IP address.
- On the Monitoring VM, update the telegraf config file with the database connection string in the following format. Please note AAD based auth is currently only supported for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance (but not for SQL Server), as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview#authentication).
- On the Monitoring VM, update the telegraf config file with the database connection string in the following format.
- On the Monitoring VM, update the telegraf config file with the database connection string in the following format. The connection string only provides the server and database name, but no password (since the VM's system-assigned managed identity would be used for authentication).
```toml
  servers = [
    "Server=<Azure_SQL_Server_Name>.database.windows.net;Port=1433;Database=<Azure_SQL_Database_Name>;app name=telegraf;log=1;",
  ]
```
- Please note AAD based auth is currently only supported for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance (but not for SQL Server), as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview#authentication).

### Metrics:
To provide backwards compatibility, this plugin support two versions of metrics queries.

**Note**: Version 2 queries are not backwards compatible with the old queries. Any dashboards or queries based on the old query format will not work with the new format. The version 2 queries only report raw metrics, no math has been done to calculate deltas. To graph this data you must calculate deltas in your dashboarding software.

#### Version 1 (query_version=1): This is Deprecated in 1.6, all future development will be under configuration option database_type.
The original metrics queries provide:
- *Performance counters*: 1000+ metrics from `sys.dm_os_performance_counters`
- *Performance metrics*: special performance and ratio metrics
- *Wait stats*: wait tasks categorized from `sys.dm_os_wait_stats`
- *Memory clerk*: memory breakdown from `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks`
- *Database size*: databases size trend from `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats`
- *Database IO*: databases I/O from `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats`
- *Database latency*: databases latency from `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats`
- *Database properties*: databases properties, state and recovery model, from `sys.databases`
- *OS Volume*: available, used and total space from `sys.dm_os_volume_stats`
- *CPU*: cpu usage from `sys.dm_os_ring_buffers`

If you are using the original queries all stats have the following tags:
- `servername`:  hostname:instance
- `type`: type of stats to easily filter measurements

#### Version 2 (query_version=2): Being deprecated, All future development will be under configuration option database_type.
The new (version 2) metrics provide:
- *Database IO*: IO stats from `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats`
- *Memory Clerk*: Memory clerk breakdown from `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks`, most clerks have been given a friendly name.
- *Performance Counters*: A select list of performance counters from `sys.dm_os_performance_counters`. Some of the important metrics included:
  - *Activity*: Transactions/sec/database, Batch requests/sec, blocked processes, + more
  - *Availability Groups*: Bytes sent to replica, Bytes received from replica, Log bytes received, Log send queue, transaction delay, + more
  - *Log activity*: Log bytes flushed/sec, Log flushes/sec, Log Flush Wait Time
  - *Memory*: PLE, Page reads/sec, Page writes/sec, + more
  - *TempDB*: Free space, Version store usage, Active temp tables, temp table creation rate, + more
  - *Resource Governor*: CPU Usage, Requests/sec, Queued Requests, and Blocked tasks per workload group + more
- *Server properties*: Number of databases in all possible states (online, offline, suspect, etc.), cpu count, physical memory, SQL Server service uptime, and SQL Server version. In the case of Azure SQL relevant properties such as Tier, #Vcores, Memory etc.
- *Wait stats*: Wait time in ms, number of waiting tasks, resource wait time, signal wait time, max wait time in ms, wait type, and wait category. The waits are categorized using the same categories used in Query Store.
- *Schedulers* - This captures `sys.dm_os_schedulers`.
- *SqlRequests* - This captures a snapshot of `sys.dm_exec_requests` and `sys.dm_exec_sessions` that gives you running requests as well as wait types and
  blocking sessions.
- *VolumeSpace* - uses `sys.dm_os_volume_stats` to get total, used and occupied space on every disk that contains a data or log file. (Note that even if enabled it won't get any data from Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance). It is pointless to run this with high frequency (ie: every 10s), but it won't cause any problem.
- *Cpu* - uses the buffer ring (`sys.dm_os_ring_buffers`) to get CPU data, the table is updated once per minute. (Note that even if enabled it won't get any data from Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance).

  In order to allow tracking on a per statement basis this query produces a
  unique tag for each query.  Depending on the database workload, this may
  result in a high cardinality series.  Reference the FAQ for tips on
  [managing series cardinality][cardinality].

- *Azure Managed Instances*
  - Stats from `sys.server_resource_stats`
  - Resource governance stats from `sys.dm_instance_resource_governance`
- *Azure SQL Database* in addition to other stats
  - Stats from `sys.dm_db_wait_stats`
  - Resource governance stats from `sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance`
  - Stats from `sys.dm_db_resource_stats`

Version 2 queries have the following tags:
- `sql_instance`: Physical host and instance name (hostname:instance)
- `database_name`:  For Azure SQLDB, database_name denotes the name of the Azure SQL Database as server name is a logical construct.

#### Health Metric
All collection versions (version 1, version 2, and database_type) support an optional plugin health metric called `sqlserver_telegraf_health`. This metric tracks if connections to SQL Server are succeeding or failing. Users can leverage this metric to detect if their SQL Server monitoring is not working as intended.

In the configuration file, toggling `health_metric` to `true` will enable collection of this metric. By default, this value is set to `false` and the metric is not collected. The health metric emits one record for each connection specified by `servers` in the configuration file.

The health metric emits the following tags:
- `sql_instance` - Name of the server specified in the connection string. This value is emitted as-is in the connection string. If the server could not be parsed from the connection string, a constant placeholder value is emitted
- `database_name` -  Name of the database or (initial catalog) specified in the connection string. This value is emitted as-is in the connection string. If the database could not be parsed from the connection string, a constant placeholder value is emitted

The health metric emits the following fields:
- `attempted_queries` - Number of queries that were attempted for this connection
- `successful_queries` - Number of queries that completed successfully for this connection
- `database_type` - Type of database as specified by `database_type`. If `database_type` is empty, the `QueryVersion` and `AzureDB` fields are concatenated instead

If `attempted_queries` and `successful_queries` are not equal for a given connection, some metrics were not successfully gathered for that connection. If `successful_queries` is 0, no metrics were successfully gathered.
