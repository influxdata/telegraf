    description
      "A binary marshalled protobuf message, with a size that does not exceed
      1MiB containing metadata related to the element of the data tree at which
      the metadata annotation is used.

      It is expected that this metadata can be both written and read by a
      client - and that the value is persistent across system restarts.

      A client using this metadata extension should ensure that it is able
      to unmarshal its contents successfully. It is suggested that the
      payload should be a protobuf.Any message, which has corresponding
      type information such that information as to the intended structure
      can be retrieved by any reader.";
