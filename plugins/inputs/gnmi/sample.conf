    ## origin usually refers to a (YANG) data model implemented by the device
    ## and path to a specific substructure inside it that should be subscribed
    ## to (similar to an XPath). YANG models can be found e.g. here:

  #  ## one key to match on. Multiple element names can be specified in any
  #  ## order. In this case all element names must be present.
