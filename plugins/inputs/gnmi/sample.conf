  ## Vendor specific options
  ## This defines what vendor specific options to load.
  ## * Juniper Header Extension (juniper_header): some sensors are directly managed by
  ##   Linecard, which adds the Juniper GNMI Header Extension. Enabling this
  ##   allows the decoding of the Extension header if present. Currently this knob
  ##   adds component, component_id & sub_component_id as additionnal tags

    ## Name of the measurement that will be emitted

    ## Origin and path of the subscription
    ## See: https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#222-paths
    ##
    ## origin usually refers to a (YANG) data model implemented by the device
    ## and path to a specific substructure inside it that should be subscribed
    ## to (similar to an XPath). YANG models can be found e.g. here:
    ## https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco/xr
    origin = "openconfig-interfaces"
    path = "/interfaces/interface/state/counters"

    ## Subscription mode ("target_defined", "sample", "on_change") and interval
    subscription_mode = "sample"
    sample_interval = "10s"

    ## Suppress redundant transmissions when measured values are unchanged
    # suppress_redundant = false

    ## If suppression is enabled, send updates at least every X seconds anyway
    # heartbeat_interval = "60s"

  ## Tag subscriptions are applied as tags to other subscriptions.
  # [[inputs.gnmi.tag_subscription]]
  #  ## When applying this value as a tag to other metrics, use this tag name
  #  name = "descr"
  #
  #  ## All other subscription fields are as normal
  #  origin = "openconfig-interfaces"
  #  path = "/interfaces/interface/state"
  #  subscription_mode = "on_change"
  #
  #  ## Match strategy to use for the tag.
  #  ## Tags are only applied for metrics of the same address. The following
  #  ## settings are valid:
  #  ##   unconditional -- always match
  #  ##   name          -- match by the "name" key
  #  ##                    This resembles the previsou 'tag-only' behavior.
  #  ##   elements      -- match by the keys in the path filtered by the path
  #  ##                    parts specified `elements` below
  #  ## By default, 'elements' is used if the 'elements' option is provided,
  #  ## otherwise match by 'name'.
  #  # match = ""
  #
  #  ## For the 'elements' match strategy, at least one path-element name must
  #  ## be supplied containing at least one key to match on. Multiple path
  #  ## elements can be specified in any order. All given keys must be equal
  #  ## for a match.
  #  # elements = ["description", "interface"]
