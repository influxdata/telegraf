# gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) Input Plugin

This plugin consumes telemetry data based on the [gNMI](https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md) Subscribe method. TLS is supported for authentication and encryption.  This input plugin is vendor-agnostic and is supported on any platform that supports the gNMI spec.

For Cisco devices: 
It has been optimized to support gNMI telemetry as produced by Cisco IOS XR (64-bit) version 6.5.1, Cisco NX-OS 9.3 and Cisco IOS XE 16.12 and later.


### Configuration

```toml
[[inputs.gnmi]]
  ## Address and port of the gNMI GRPC server
  addresses = ["10.49.234.114:57777"]

  ## define credentials
  username = "cisco"
  password = "cisco"

  ## gNMI encoding requested (one of: "proto", "json", "json_ietf", "bytes")
  # encoding = "proto"

  ## redial in case of failures after
  redial = "10s"

  ## enable client-side TLS and define CA to authenticate the device
  # enable_tls = true
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # insecure_skip_verify = true

  ## define client-side TLS certificate & key to authenticate to the device
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"

  ## gNMI subscription prefix (optional, can usually be left empty)
  ## See: https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#222-paths
  # origin = ""
  # prefix = ""
  # target = ""

  ## Define additional aliases to map telemetry encoding paths to simple measurement names
  # [inputs.gnmi.aliases]
  #   ifcounters = "openconfig:/interfaces/interface/state/counters"

  [[inputs.gnmi.subscription]]
    ## Name of the measurement that will be emitted
    name = "ifcounters"

    ## Origin and path of the subscription
    ## See: https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#222-paths
    ##
    ## origin usually refers to a (YANG) data model implemented by the device
    ## and path to a specific substructure inside it that should be subscribed to (similar to an XPath)
    ## YANG models can be found e.g. here: https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco/xr
    origin = "openconfig-interfaces"
    path = "/interfaces/interface/state/counters"

    # Subscription mode (one of: "target_defined", "sample", "on_change") and interval
    subscription_mode = "sample"
    sample_interval = "10s"

    ## Suppress redundant transmissions when measured values are unchanged
    # suppress_redundant = false

    ## If suppression is enabled, send updates at least every X seconds anyway
    # heartbeat_interval = "60s"
```
