# LDAP monitoring plugin
[[inputs.ldap]]
  ## Server to monitor
  ## The scheme determines the mode to use for connection with
  ##    ldap://...      -- unencrypted (non-TLS) connection
  ##    ldaps://...     -- TLS connection
  ##    starttls://...  --  StartTLS connection
  ##    ldapi://...     -- UNIX socket connection
  ## If no port is given, the default ports, 389 for ldap and starttls and
  ## 636 for ldaps, are used, there is no port on UNIX sockets.
  server = "ldap://localhost"

  ## Server dialect, can be "openldap" or "389ds"
  # dialect = "openldap"

  # What sort of Bind to use
  ## Empty or "simple" means to use a simple LDAP bind, otherwise use a
  ## specified SASL mechanism (only EXTERNAL currently supported - for TLS
  ## client certs or UNIX credentials)
  # bind_mechanism = "simple"

  # DN and password to bind with
  ## If bind_dn is empty an anonymous bind is performed.
  bind_dn = ""
  bind_password = ""

  ## Reverse the field names constructed from the monitoring DN
  # reverse_field_names = false

  ## Optional TLS Config
