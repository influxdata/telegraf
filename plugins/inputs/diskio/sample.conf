# Read metrics about disk IO by device
[[inputs.diskio]]
  ## Devices to collect stats for
  ## Wildcards are supported except for disk synonyms like '/dev/disk/by-id'.
  ## ex. devices = ["sda", "sdb", "vd*", "/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.00123deadc0de123"]
  # devices = ["*"]

  ## Skip gathering of the disk's serial numbers.
  # skip_serial_number = true

  ## Device metadata tags to add on systems supporting it (Linux only)
  ## Use 'udevadm info -q property -n <device>' to get a list of properties.
  ## Note: Most, but not all, udev properties can be accessed this way. Properties
  ## that are currently inaccessible include DEVTYPE, DEVNAME, and DEVPATH.
  # device_tags = ["ID_FS_TYPE", "ID_FS_USAGE"]

  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.
  ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
  ## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
  ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
  ## the near-meaningless DM-0 name.
  # name_templates = ["$ID_FS_LABEL","$DM_VG_NAME/$DM_LV_NAME"]
