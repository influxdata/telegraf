  ## The devices to query. For each device the corresponding URL including the
  ## user and passwort needed to login must be set.
  ## E.g.
  ## devices = [
  ##   "http://boxuser:boxpassword@fritz.box:49000/",
  ##   "http://:repeaterpassword@fritz.repeater:49000/",
  ## ]
  devices = [
    "http://myuser:mypassword@fritz.box",
    "http://myuser:mypassword@fritz.repeater",
  ]

  ## The information to query (see README for further details).
  ## Hosts info is disabled by default, as it generates an extensive amount
  ## of data.
  device_info = false
  wan_info = false
  ppp_info = false
  dsl_info = false
  wlan_info = false
  hosts_info = true

  ## Some metric queries are time-consuming and not collected on every query
  ## cycle. This counter defines how often these low-traffic queries
  ## are excuted. The default value 30 means, on every 30th query corresponding
  ## to every 5 minutes (assuming the standard query interval of 10s).
  ## If this option is set to 1 or below, all metrics are collected on every
  ## query cycle.
  full_query_cycle = 6

  ## The http timeout to use (in seconds).
  timeout = "1m"

  ## Skip TLS verification (insecure)
  tls_skip_verify = true

  ## Enable debug output
  debug = true
