  ## Optional tag name used to store the database name.
  ## If the write has a database in the query string then it will be kept in this tag name.
  ## This tag can be used in downstream outputs.
  ## The default value of nothing means it will be off and the database will not be recorded.

  ## You probably want to make sure you have TLS configured above for this.

  ## 'internal' is the default. 'upstream' is a newer parser that is faster
