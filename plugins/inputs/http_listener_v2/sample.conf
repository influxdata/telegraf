# Generic HTTP write listener
[[inputs.http_listener_v2]]
  ## Address and port to host HTTP listener on
  service_address = ":8080"

  ## Paths to listen to.
  # paths = ["/telegraf"]

  ## Save path as http_listener_v2_path tag if set to true
  # path_tag = false

  ## HTTP methods to accept.
  # methods = ["POST", "PUT"]

  ## Optional HTTP headers
  ## These headers are applied to the server that is listening for HTTP
  ## requests and included in responses.
  # http_headers = {"HTTP_HEADER" = "TAG_NAME"}

  ## maximum duration before timing out read of the request
  # read_timeout = "10s"
  ## maximum duration before timing out write of the response
  # write_timeout = "10s"

  ## Maximum allowed http request body size in bytes.
  ## 0 means to use the default of 524,288,000 bytes (500 mebibytes)
  # max_body_size = "500MB"

  ## Part of the request to consume.  Available options are "body" and
  ## "query".
  # data_source = "body"

  ## Set one or more allowed client CA certificate file names to
  ## enable mutually authenticated TLS connections
  # tls_allowed_cacerts = ["/etc/telegraf/clientca.pem"]

  ## Add service certificate and key
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"

  ## Minimal TLS version accepted by the server
  # tls_min_version = "TLS12"

  ## Optional username and password to accept for HTTP basic authentication.
  ## You probably want to make sure you have TLS configured above for this.
  # basic_username = "foobar"
  # basic_password = "barfoo"

  ## Optional setting to map http headers into tags
  ## If the http header is not present on the request, no corresponding tag will be added
  ## If multiple instances of the http header are present, only the first value will be used
  # http_header_tags = {"HTTP_HEADER" = "TAG_NAME"}

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
