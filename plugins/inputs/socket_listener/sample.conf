  ## Change the file mode bits on unix sockets.  These permissions may not be
  ## respected by some platforms, to safely restrict write permissions it is best
  ## to place the socket into a directory that has previously been created
  ## with the desired permissions.
  ##   ex: socket_mode = "777"
  # socket_mode = ""

  ## Maximum number of concurrent connections.
  ## Only applies to stream sockets (e.g. TCP).
  ## 0 (default) is unlimited.
  # max_connections = 1024

  ## Read timeout.
  ## Only applies to stream sockets (e.g. TCP).
  ## 0 (default) is unlimited.
  # read_timeout = "30s"

  ## Optional TLS configuration.
  ## Only applies to stream sockets (e.g. TCP).
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key  = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Enables client authentication if set.
  # tls_allowed_cacerts = ["/etc/telegraf/clientca.pem"]

  ## Maximum socket buffer size (in bytes when no unit specified).
  ## For stream sockets, once the buffer fills up, the sender will start backing up.
  ## For datagram sockets, once the buffer fills up, metrics will start dropping.
  ## Defaults to the OS default.
  # read_buffer_size = "64KiB"

  ## Period between keep alive probes.
  ## Only applies to TCP sockets.
  ## 0 disables keep alive probes.
  ## Defaults to the OS configuration.
  # keep_alive_period = "5m"

  ## Data format to consume.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  # data_format = "influx"

  ## Content encoding for message payloads, can be set to "gzip" to or
  ## "identity" to apply no encoding.
  # content_encoding = "identity"

  ## Message splitting strategy and corresponding settings for stream sockets
  ## (tcp, tcp4, tcp6, unix or unixpacket). The setting is ignored for packet
  ## listeners such as udp.
  ## Available strategies are:
  ##   newline         -- split at newlines (default)
  ##   null            -- split at null bytes
  ##   delimiter       -- split at delimiter byte-sequence in hex-format
  ##                      given in `splitting_delimiter`
  ##   fixed length    -- split after number of bytes given in `splitting_length`
  ##   variable length -- split depending on length information received in the
  ##                      data. The length field information is specified in
  ##                      `splitting_length_field`.
  # splitting_strategy = "newline"

  ## Delimiter used to split received data to messages consumed by the parser.
  ## The delimiter is a hex byte-sequence marking the end of a message
  ## e.g. "0x0D0A", "x0d0a" or "0d0a" marks a Windows line-break (CR LF).
  ## The value is case-insensitive and can be specifed with "0x" or "x" prefix
  ## or withou.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "delimiter".
  # slitting_delimiter = ""

  ## Fixed length of a message in bytes.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "fixed length".
  # splitting_length = 0

  ## Specification of the length field contained in the data to split messages
  ## with variable length. The specification contains the following fields:
  ##  offset        -- start of length field in bytes from begin of data
  ##  bytes         -- length of length field in bytes
  ##  endianness    -- endianness of the value, either "be" for big endian or
  ##                   "le" for little endian
  ##  header_length -- total length of header to be skipped when passing
  ##                   data on to the parser. If zero (default), the header
  ##                   is passed on to the parser together with the message.
  ## Note: This setting is only used for splitting_strategy = "variable length".
  # splitting_length_field = {offset = 0, bytes = 0, endianness = "be", header_length = 0}
