  ## The directory to move files to upon file error.

  #
  ## The amount of time a file is allowed to sit in the directory before it is picked up.
  ## This time can generally be low but if you choose to have a very large file written to the directory and it's potentially slow,
  ## set this higher so that the plugin will wait until the file is fully copied to the directory.
  # directory_duration_threshold = "50ms"

  ## A list of the only file names to monitor, if necessary. Supports regex. If left blank, all files are ingested.

  ## A list of files to ignore, if necessary. Supports regex.
  # files_to_ignore = [".DS_Store"]

  ## Maximum lines of the file to process that have not yet be written by the
  ## output. For best throughput set to the size of the output's metric_buffer_limit.
  ## Warning: setting this number higher than the output's metric_buffer_limit can cause dropped metrics.
  # max_buffered_metrics = 10000
  #
  ## The maximum amount of file paths to queue up for processing at once, before waiting until files are processed to find more files.
  ## Lowering this value will result in *slightly* less memory use, with a potential sacrifice in speed efficiency, if absolutely necessary.
  # file_queue_size = 100000
  #
  ## Name a tag containing the name of the file the data was parsed from.  Leave empty
  ## to disable. Cautious when file name variation is high, this can increase the cardinality
  ## significantly. Read more about cardinality here:

  # file_tag = ""
  #
  ## Specify if the file can be read completely at once or if it needs to be read line by line (default).
  ## Possible values: line-by-line, complete-file
  # parse_method = "line-by-line" 
  #
  ## The dataformat to be read from the files.
  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:

  ## NOTE: We currently only support parsing newline-delimited JSON. See the format here: https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec
