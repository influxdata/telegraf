  ## Specify the ali cloud region list to be queried for metrics and objects discovery
  ## If not set, all supported regions (see below) would be covered, it can provide a significant load on API, so the recommendation here
  ## is to limit the list as much as possible. Allowed values: https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/40654.htm
  ## Default supported regions are:
  ## 21 items: cn-qingdao,cn-beijing,cn-zhangjiakou,cn-huhehaote,cn-hangzhou,cn-shanghai,cn-shenzhen,
  ##           cn-heyuan,cn-chengdu,cn-hongkong,ap-southeast-1,ap-southeast-2,ap-southeast-3,ap-southeast-5,
  ##           ap-south-1,ap-northeast-1,us-west-1,us-east-1,eu-central-1,eu-west-1,me-east-1
  ##
  ## From discovery perspective it set the scope for object discovery, the discovered info can be used to enrich
  ## the metrics with objects attributes/tags. Discovery is supported not for all projects (if not supported, then
  ## it will be reported on the start - for example for 'acs_cdn' project:
  ## 'E! [inputs.aliyuncms] Discovery tool is not activated: no discovery support for project "acs_cdn"' )
  ## Currently, discovery supported for the following projects:
  ## - acs_ecs_dashboard
  ## - acs_rds_dashboard
  ## - acs_slb_dashboard
  ## - acs_vpc_eip

  # The minimum period for AliyunCMS metrics is 1 minute (60s). However not all
  # metrics are made available to the 1 minute period. Some are collected at
  # 3 minute, 5 minute, or larger intervals.
  # See: https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/51936.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.18.2bc1750eeOw1Pv
  # Note that if a period is configured that is smaller than the minimum for a
  # particular metric, that metric will not be returned by the Aliyun OpenAPI
  # and will not be collected by Telegraf.
  #
  ## Requested AliyunCMS aggregation Period (required - must be a multiple of 60s)
  period = "5m"

  ## Collection Delay (required - must account for metrics availability via AliyunCMS API)
  delay = "1m"

  ## Recommended: use metric 'interval' that is a multiple of 'period' to avoid
  ## gaps or overlap in pulled data
  interval = "5m"

  ## Metric Statistic Project (required)
  project = "acs_slb_dashboard"

  ## Maximum requests per second, default value is 200
  ratelimit = 200

  ## How often the discovery API call executed (default 1m)
  #discovery_interval = "1m"

  ## Metrics to Pull (Required)
  [[inputs.aliyuncms.metrics]]
  ## Metrics names to be requested,
  ## described here (per project): https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/28619.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.6.690.1938ad41wg8QSq
  names = ["InstanceActiveConnection", "InstanceNewConnection"]

  ## Dimension filters for Metric (these are optional).
  ## This allows to get additional metric dimension. If dimension is not specified it can be returned or
  ## the data can be aggregated - it depends on particular metric, you can find details here: https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/28619.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.6.690.1938ad41wg8QSq
  ##
  ## Note, that by default dimension filter includes the list of discovered objects in scope (if discovery is enabled)
  ## Values specified here would be added into the list of discovered objects.
  ## You can specify either single dimension:
  #dimensions = '{"instanceId": "p-example"}'

  ## Or you can specify several dimensions at once:
  #dimensions = '[{"instanceId": "p-example"},{"instanceId": "q-example"}]'

  ## Enrichment tags, can be added from discovery (if supported)
  ## Notation is <measurement_tag_name>:<JMES query path (https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html)>
  ## To figure out which fields are available, consult the Describe<ObjectType> API per project.
  ## For example, for SLB: https://api.aliyun.com/#/?product=Slb&version=2014-05-15&api=DescribeLoadBalancers&params={}&tab=MOCK&lang=GO
  #tag_query_path = [
  #    "address:Address",
  #    "name:LoadBalancerName",
  #    "cluster_owner:Tags.Tag[?TagKey=='cs.cluster.name'].TagValue | [0]"
  #    ]
  ## The following tags added by default: regionId (if discovery enabled), userId, instanceId.

  ## Allow metrics without discovery data, if discovery is enabled. If set to true, then metric without discovery
  ## data would be emitted, otherwise dropped. This cane be of help, in case debugging dimension filters, or partial coverage
  ## of discovery scope vs monitoring scope
  #allow_dps_without_discovery = false
