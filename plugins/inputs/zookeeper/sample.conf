# Reads 'mntr' stats from one or many zookeeper servers
[[inputs.zookeeper]]
  ## An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
  ## with port. ie localhost:2181, 10.0.0.1:2181, etc.

  ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
  ## If no port is specified, 2181 is used
  servers = [":2181"]

  ## Timeout for metric collections from all servers.  Minimum timeout is "1s".
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Float Parsing - the initial implementation forced any value unable to be
  ## parsed as an int to be a string. Setting this to "float" will attempt to
  ## parse float values as floats and not strings. This would break existing
  ## metrics and may cause issues if a value switches between a float and int.
  # parse_floats = "string"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # enable_tls = false
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## If false, skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = true
