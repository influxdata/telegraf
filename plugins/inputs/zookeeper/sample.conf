# Reads metrics from one or many zookeeper servers
[[inputs.zookeeper]]
  ## An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
  ## with port. ie localhost:2181, 10.0.0.1:2181, etc.
  ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
  ## If no port is specified, 2181 is used for java and 7000 for prometheus
  ## metric providers.
  servers = [":2181"]

  ## Timeout for metric collections from all servers.  Minimum timeout is "1s".
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Metrics Provider
  ## Choose from: "java" or "prometheus". By default, mntr is used to collect
  ## metrics produced in the Java Properties format. There is the option to
  ## also produce Prometheus style metrics from Zookeeper. This requires
  ## additional configuraiton. Using this provider requires the use of a
  ## different port, 7000 by default, and will produce metrics in a different
  ## format.
  # metrics_provider = "java"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # enable_tls = true
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## If false, skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = true
