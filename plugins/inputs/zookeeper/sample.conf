# Reads 'mntr' stats from one or many zookeeper servers
[[inputs.zookeeper]]
  ## An array of address to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
  ## with port. ie localhost:2181, 10.0.0.1:2181, etc.

  ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
  ## If no port is specified, 2181 is used
  servers = [":2181"]

  ## Timeout for metric collections from all servers.  Minimum timeout is "1s".
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Float Parsing - the initial implementation forced any value unable to be
  ## parsed as an int to be a string. Setting this to "float" will attempt to
  ## parse float values as floats and not strings. This would break existing
  ## metrics and may cause issues if a value switches between a float and int.
  # parse_floats = "string"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  ## Set to true/false to enforce TLS being enabled/disabled. If not set,
  ## enable TLS only if any of the other options are specified.
  # tls_enable =
  ## Trusted root certificates for server
  # tls_ca = "/path/to/cafile"
  ## Used for TLS client certificate authentication
  # tls_cert = "/path/to/certfile"
  ## Used for TLS client certificate authentication
  # tls_key = "/path/to/keyfile"
  ## Password for the key file if it is encrypted
  # tls_key_pwd = ""
  ## Send the specified TLS server name via SNI
  # tls_server_name = "kubernetes.example.com"
  ## Minimal TLS version to accept by the client
  # tls_min_version = "TLS12"
  ## List of ciphers to accept, by default all secure ciphers will be accepted
  ## See https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#pkg-constants for supported values.
  ## Use "all", "secure" and "insecure" to add all support ciphers, secure
  ## suites or insecure suites respectively.
  # tls_cipher_suites = ["secure"]
  ## Renegotiation method, "never", "once" or "freely"
  # tls_renegotiation_method = "never"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
