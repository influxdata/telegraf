# Sysstat metrics collector
[[inputs.sysstat]]
  ## Path to the sadc command.
  #
  ## Common Defaults:
  ##   Debian/Ubuntu: /usr/lib/sysstat/sadc
  ##   Arch:          /usr/lib/sa/sadc
  ##   RHEL/CentOS:   /usr/lib64/sa/sadc
  sadc_path = "/usr/lib/sa/sadc" # required

  ## Path to the sadf command, if it is not in PATH
  # sadf_path = "/usr/bin/sadf"

  ## Activities is a list of activities, that are passed as argument to the
  ## sadc collector utility (e.g: DISK, SNMP etc...)
  ## The more activities that are added, the more data is collected.
  # activities = ["DISK"]

  ## Group metrics to measurements.
  ##
  ## If group is false each metric will be prefixed with a description
  ## and represents itself a measurement.
  ##
  ## If Group is true, corresponding metrics are grouped to a single measurement.
  # group = true

  ## Options for the sadf command. The values on the left represent the sadf options and
  ## the values on the right their description (wich are used for grouping and prefixing metrics).
  ##
  ## Run 'sar -h' or 'man sar' to find out the supported options for your sysstat version.

  ## Device tags can be used to add additional tags for devices. For example the configuration below
  ## adds a tag vg with value rootvg for all metrics with sda devices.
  # [[inputs.sysstat.device_tags.sda]]
  #  vg = "rootvg"
