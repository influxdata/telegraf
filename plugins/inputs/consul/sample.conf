# Gather health check statuses from services registered in Consul
[[inputs.consul]]
  ## Consul server address
  # address = "localhost:8500"

  ## URI scheme for the Consul server, one of "http", "https"
  # scheme = "http"

  ## Metric version controls the mapping from Consul metrics into
  ## Telegraf metrics. Version 2 moved all fields with string values
  ## to tags.
  ##
  ##   example: metric_version = 1; deprecated in 1.16
  ##            metric_version = 2; recommended version
  # metric_version = 1

  ## ACL token used in every request
  # token = ""

  ## HTTP Basic Authentication username and password.
  # username = ""
  # password = ""

  ## Data center to query the health checks from
  # datacenter = ""

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = true

  ## Consul checks' tag splitting
  # When tags are formatted like "key:value" with ":" as a delimiter then
  # they will be splitted and reported as proper key:value in Telegraf
  # tag_delimiter = ":"
