# Teamspeak Input Plugin

This plugin collects statistics of one or more virtual [Teamspeak][teamspeak]
servers using the `ServerQuery` interface. Currently this plugin only supports
Teamspeak 3 servers.

> [!NOTE]
> For querying external Teamspeak server, make sure to add the Telegraf host
> to the `query_ip_allowlist.txt` file in the Teamspeak Server directory.
