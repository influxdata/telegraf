# InfluxDB Input Plugin

The InfluxDB plugin will collect metrics on the given InfluxDB v1 servers from
the `/debug/vars` endpoint. Read the [documentation][1] for detailed
information about `influxdb` metrics. For InfluxDB v2 and the `metrics`
endpoint please see the section below.

This plugin can also gather metrics from endpoints that expose
InfluxDB-formatted endpoints. See below for more information.

[1]: https://docs.influxdata.com/platform/monitoring/influxdata-platform/tools/measurements-internal/

## InfluxDB v2 Metrics

For [InfluxDB v2 metrics][2] are produced in Prometheus plain-text format. To
collect metrics at the new `/metrics` endpoint, please use the Prometheus
input plugin. This is an example to collect from a local database:

```toml
[[inputs.prometheus]]
  urls = ["http://localhost:8086/metrics"]
  metric_version = 1
```

[2]: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/reference/internals/metrics/

## Global configuration options <!-- @/docs/includes/plugin_config.md -->

In addition to the plugin-specific configuration settings, plugins support
additional global and plugin configuration settings. These settings are used to
modify metrics, tags, and field or create aliases and configure ordering, etc.
See the [CONFIGURATION.md][CONFIGURATION.md] for more details.

[CONFIGURATION.md]: ../../../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#plugins

## Configuration

```toml @sample.conf
# Read InfluxDB-formatted JSON metrics from one or more HTTP endpoints
[[inputs.influxdb]]
  ## Works with InfluxDB debug endpoints out of the box,
  ## but other services can use this format too.
  ## See the influxdb plugin's README for more details.

  ## Multiple URLs from which to read InfluxDB-formatted JSON
  ## Default is "http://localhost:8086/debug/vars".
  urls = [
    "http://localhost:8086/debug/vars"
  ]

  ## Username and password to send using HTTP Basic Authentication.
  # username = ""
  # password = ""

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ## http request & header timeout
  timeout = "5s"
```

## InfluxDB-formatted endpoints

The influxdb plugin can collect InfluxDB-formatted data from JSON endpoints.
Whether associated with an Influx database or not.

With a configuration of:

```toml
[[inputs.influxdb]]
  urls = [
    "http://127.0.0.1:8086/debug/vars",
    "http://192.168.2.1:8086/debug/vars"
  ]
```
