  ## "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/custom/lib64:/usr/local/libs"
  # environment = []

  ## Timeout for each command to complete.
  # timeout = "5s"

  # ignore_error = false

  ## Data format
  ## By default, exec expects JSON. This was done for historical reasons and is
  ## different than other inputs that use the influx line protocol. Each data
  ## format has its own unique set of configuration options, read more about
  ## them here:
  ## https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md
  # data_format = "json"
