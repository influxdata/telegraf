# Telegraf configuration

# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs.

# Even if a plugin has no configuration, it must be declared in here
# to be active. Declaring a plugin means just specifying the name
# as a section with no variables. To deactivate a plugin, comment
# out the name and any variables.

# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.toml -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.

# One rule that plugins conform to is wherever a connection string
# can be passed, the values '' and 'localhost' are treated specially.
# They indicate to the plugin to use their own builtin configuration to
# connect to the local system.

# NOTE: The configuration has a few required parameters. They are marked
# with 'required'. Be sure to edit those to make this configuration work.

# Tags can also be specified via a normal map, but only one form at a time:
[tags]
  # dc = "us-east-1"

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  # Default data collection interval for all plugins
  interval = "10s"
  # Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  # ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  # Default data flushing interval for all outputs. You should not set this below
  # interval. Maximum flush_interval will be flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "10s"
  # Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  # large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  # ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"

  # Run telegraf in debug mode
  debug = false
  # Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = ""
