# Telegraf configuration

# If this file is missing an [agent] section, you must first generate a
# valid config with 'telegraf -sample-config > telegraf.toml'

# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared plugins.

# Even if a plugin has no configuration, it must be declared in here
# to be active. Declaring a plugin means just specifying the name
# as a section with no variables. To deactivate a plugin, comment
# out the name and any variables.

# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.toml -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.

# One rule that plugins conform to is wherever a connection string
# can be passed, the values '' and 'localhost' are treated specially.
# They indicate to the plugin to use their own builtin configuration to
# connect to the local system.

# NOTE: The configuration has a few required parameters. They are marked
# with 'required'. Be sure to edit those to make this configuration work.

# OUTPUTS
[outputs]

# Configuration for influxdb server to send metrics to
[outputs.influxdb]
# The full HTTP endpoint URL for your InfluxDB instance
url = "http://localhost:8086" # required.

# The target database for metrics. This database must already exist
database = "telegraf" # required.

# username = "telegraf"
# password = "metricsmetricsmetricsmetrics"

# Set the user agent for the POSTs (can be useful for log differentiation)
# user_agent = "telegraf"

# tags = { "dc" = "us-east-1" }

# Configuration for telegraf itself
# [agent]
# interval = "10s"

# PLUGINS

# Read metrics about cpu usage

  # no configuration

# Read metrics about disk usage by mount point
[disk]
  # no configuration

# Read metrics about docker containers
[docker]
  # no configuration

# Read metrics about disk IO by device
[io]
  # no configuration

# Read metrics about memory usage

# Read metrics from one or many mysql servers
[mysql]

# specify servers via a url matching:
#  [username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/[?tls=[true|false|skip-verify]]

# If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.

# or a simple string:
#   host=localhost user=pqotest password=... sslmode=...
#
# All connection parameters are optional. By default, the host is localhost
# and the user is the currently running user. For localhost, we default
# to sslmode=disable as well.
