# Telegraf configuration

# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared plugins.

# Even if a plugin has no configuration, it must be declared in here
# to be active. Declaring a plugin means just specifying the name
# as a section with no variables. To deactivate a plugin, comment
# out the name and any variables.

# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.toml -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.

# One rule that plugins conform to is wherever a connection string
# can be passed, the values '' and 'localhost' are treated specially.
# They indicate to the plugin to use their own builtin configuration to
# connect to the local system.

# NOTE: The configuration has a few required parameters. They are marked
# with 'required'. Be sure to edit those to make this configuration work.

# Tags can also be specified via a normal map, but only one form at a time:
[tags]
	# dc = "us-east-1"

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
	# Default data collection interval for all plugins
	interval = "10s"

	# If utc = false, uses local time (utc is highly recommended)
	utc = true

	# Precision of writes, valid values are n, u, ms, s, m, and h
	# note: using second precision greatly helps InfluxDB compression
	precision = "s"

	# run telegraf in debug mode
	debug = false

	# Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
	hostname = ""
