Security None CreateSession ActivateSession
When SecurityPolicy=None, the CreateSession and ActivateSession service allow for a NULL/empty signature and do not require Application Certificates or a Nonce.
(OPT) Security None CreateSession ActivateSession 1.0
	The Client can connect to Servers that require a certificate being passed on Session establishment.
	The Client in this case will first try without a certificate and if this fails present a certificate.
