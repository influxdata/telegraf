This was renamed to [`xdg-go/scram`](https://github.com/xdg/stringprep) in October 2018.  This didn't break dependencies at the time because Github redirected requests.  In March 2021, I made `xdg-go/scram` a module, which can't be used as `xdg/scram` with Github redirects.  This repository has been recreated to support legacy dependencies.
