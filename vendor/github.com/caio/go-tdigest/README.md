# T-Digest

A fast map-reduce and parallel streaming friendly data-structure for accurate
quantile approximation.

This package provides an implementation of Ted Dunning's t-digest data
structure in Go.

## Project Status

This project is actively maintained. We are happy to collaborate on features
and issues if/when they arrive.

## Installation

Our releases are tagged and signed following the [Semantic Versioning][semver]
scheme. If you are using a dependency manager such as [dep][], the recommended
way to is go about your business normally:

    go get github.com/caio/go-tdigest

Otherwise we recommend to use the following so that you don't risk breaking
your build because of an API change:

    go get gopkg.in/caio/go-tdigest.v2

[semver]: http://semver.org/
[dep]: https://github.com/golang/dep

## Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"

	"github.com/caio/go-tdigest"
)

func main() {
	// Analogue to tdigest.New(tdigest.Compression(100))
	t, _ := tdigest.New()

	for i := 0; i < 10000; i++ {
		// Analogue to t.AddWeighted(rand.Float64(), 1)
		t.Add(rand.Float64())
	}

	fmt.Printf("p(.5) = %.6f\n", t.Quantile(0.5))
	fmt.Printf("CDF(Quantile(.5)) = %.6f\n", t.CDF(t.Quantile(0.5)))
}
```

## Configuration

You can configure your digest upon creation with options documented
at [options.go](options.go). Example:

```go
// Construct a digest with compression=200 and its own
// (thread-unsafe) RNG seeded with 0xCA10:
digest, _ := tdigest.New(
        tdigest.Compression(200),
        tdigest.LocalRandomNumberGenerator(0xCA10),
)
```

## Porting Existing Code to the v2 API

It's very easy to migrate to the new API:

- Replace `tdigest.New(100)` with `tdigest.New()`
- Replace `tdigest.New(number)` with `tdigest.New(tdigest.Compression(number))`
- Replace `Add(x,1)` with `Add(x)`
- Replace `Add(x, weight)` with `AddWeighted(x, weight)`
- Remove any use of `tdigest.Len()` (or [open an issue][issues])

## References

This is a port of the [reference][1] implementation with some ideas borrowed
from the [python version][2]. If you wanna get a quick grasp of how it works
and why it's useful, [this video and companion article is pretty helpful][3].
